/**
 * CasualSheets — minimal React wrapper around Univer Sheets.
 *
 * Boots Univer with the eager plugin set (render + formula engine +
 * UI + docs + sheets + sheets-ui + sheets-formula + numfmt), mounts a
 * single workbook unit from `initialData`, and hands the host the
 * `CasualSheetsAPI` imperative ref via `onReady` (raw FUniver facade
 * available at `api.univer`).
 *
 * Feature plugins (conditional formatting, data validation, drawings,
 * sort, filter, hyperlinks, tables, comments, find/replace) load lazily
 * by default (`lazyPlugins`): eagerly before mount for whatever the
 * snapshot already uses, idle-loaded otherwise. Pass `lazyPlugins={false}`
 * for the minimal editor.
 *
 * Formula compute runs on the main thread by default; pass `formula={{ worker }}`
 * to move it off-thread (the SDK then wires `UniverRPCMainThreadPlugin` to the
 * host's worker — see the `formula` prop).
 *
 * Intentionally NOT included (host can layer on top via FUniver):
 *   - Snapshot swap (this component mounts a snapshot once; change
 *     the React `key` to remount with a fresh snapshot).
 *   - Paste-merge hooks, dev helpers, zoom-shortcut overrides,
 *     facade extensions — all app concerns.
 *
 * Styles: host must import `@casualoffice/sheets/styles.css`
 * (or the per-plugin CSS) once at app boot. Tree-shaking strips the
 * styles from this entry if the host doesn't reach the styles export.
