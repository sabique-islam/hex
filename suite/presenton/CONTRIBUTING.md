# Development Setup (Docker / Web)

Presenton runs as a self-hosted web stack:

- **FastAPI backend** in `servers/fastapi`
- **Next.js frontend** in `servers/nextjs`
- **Docker** via `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `start.js`

### Prerequisites

- Docker (recommended), or
- Node.js 20+, Python 3.11, `uv`, and nginx for local `start.js`

### Quick start with Docker

```bash
docker compose up production
```

Open http://localhost:5001 after the container is healthy.

### Repository tests

```bash
npm test
npm run sync:presentation-export
npm run check:presentation-export
```

FastAPI tests:

```bash
cd servers/fastapi
uv sync --locked --dev
uv run python -m pytest
```

Next.js tests:

```bash
cd servers/nextjs
npm ci
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build
```
