# 17 — Production-Readiness Audit: the Four Fidelities

**Date:** 2026-06-19 (Phase-3 conclusion revised 2026-06-21 after real-world fixtures; PRs #10–#16)
**Status:** Honest-state assessment. Supersedes the optimistic framing in the status block of `CLAUDE.md` and the headline of `roundtrip-audit-report.md`. **For live visual-fidelity tracking use [[19-content-drops-and-inconsistencies]] (content drops) and [[20-overlap-and-interaction]] (overlap/interaction) — they are authoritative; the Phase-3 conclusion here is historical and was over-optimistic on the synthetic corpus.**
**Method:** Three independent code-reading audits (visual rendering, co-editing persistence, editing input), deliberately skeptical of the docs, citing source. No claims from memory.

---

## TL;DR

The product measures **one** fidelity (data round-trip) and reports it as if it proved **four**. It does not.

| Fidelity | What it means | Measured? | Honest score |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Data round-trip** | `serialize(parse(x))` drops no OOXML tags | Yes — `roundtrip-audit.mjs`, 39/39 | Real, strong |
| **Visual** | Rendered page looks like Word renders it | **No** — zero pixel-diff vs Word/LO | ~6/10, unverified |
| **Co-editing** | Preserved OOXML survives collaborative save | **No** — no co-edit→save→roundtrip test | Plausibly-to-definitely broken |
| **Editing/input** | Production-grade typing, IME, undo, paste | Partially (perf only) | Janky by architecture |

The "39/39 pristine" number is genuine but answers only the first row. It is being used as a proxy for the other three, and it is not one. This is the gap between "high-fidelity converter with a demo editor" and "production editor."

Two of the three problem areas (co-editing envelope loss, off-screen-PM input) are **architectural, not patchable**.

---

## 1. Visual fidelity — ~6/10, and completely unmeasured

### 1.1 There is no visual measurement at all
- **`scripts/roundtrip-audit.mjs`** ("39/39 pristine"): `countTags()` regex-diffs `document.xml` of `serialize(parse(x))` vs input. Never instantiates the editor, never renders, never opens a browser. "Pristine" = no OOXML tag dropped on save.
- **`scripts/compare-fidelity.mjs`**: same tag-counting; its own header (line 315) disclaims *"Tag-count retention is an imperfect signal."*
- **`e2e/tests/visual-regression.spec.ts`**: uses Playwright `toHaveScreenshot()`, but baselines are the **editor's own prior output** (self-consistency — "did we change," not "does it match Word"), and content is trivial ("Hello world", bold/italic). No real-world `.docx`, no reference renderer.
- **`scripts/ground-truth/`**: has LibreOffice PNGs (`render.py`, 300 DPI) + `open-for-review.sh` that opens fixtures in Word Online / Google Docs for a **human to eyeball table borders**. Manual, ad-hoc, not in CI, not comprehensive.
- The ~836 e2e assertions (`e2e/helpers/assertions.ts`) check "DOM has a table / a bold span / N pages exist" — never "it looks right."
- `docs/internal/01-fidelity-gaps.md:241` lists "run against a real-world stress corpus and log every visible deviation from Word" as an **unstarted** follow-up. It was never done.

**The distinction the user drew is exactly correct: we assert structure, never appearance.**

### 1.2 Pagination will not match Word
Text measurement is real (HTML5 Canvas `ctx.measureText`, `layout-bridge/measuring/measureContainer.ts`) and pagination is metric-driven (real `paginator.ts`, measured line heights) — better than naive CSS flow. But:
- **Font substitution drift.** `utils/fontResolver.ts` maps Calibri→Carlito, Arial→Arimo, Times New Roman→Tinos, Garamond/Palatino→EB Garamond. On any machine without the real Office fonts (every Mac, the Linux render server), the browser uses substitutes whose advance widths/kerning differ → different line breaks → different page breaks. Per-font `singleLineRatio` corrects *line height* only, never *advance width*.
- **Ascent/descent are ink bounds, not OS/2 metrics** (`measureContainer.ts:186-208`, from `actualBoundingBox` of `'Hg'`), a pragmatic approximation of Word's metric model. Close for single-spaced Latin; drifts for mixed sizes / tall scripts / substituted fonts.

Net: "we say 4 pages, Word says 5," paragraphs split at the wrong line.

### 1.3 Data-preserved-but-visually-wrong (round-trips fine, renders wrong)
| Feature | Evidence |
|---|---|
| ~~**Widow/orphan control** — *not implemented*~~ **IMPLEMENTED (2026-06-21)** — `layoutParagraph` keeps >=2 lines of a split paragraph on each side of a page/column break (Word default §17.3.1.44); orphan-push + widow-pull, unit-tested (`widowOrphan.test.ts`). Applied by default; explicit `w:val=0` opt-out not yet plumbed. | `layout-engine/index.ts` |
| **Page/margin/column-anchored shapes/textboxes** snap to text cursor, not real position | `renderTextBox.ts:86-100` forces `dxPx/dyPx=0` for non-paragraph anchors |
| **Tight/through image wrap** → square wrap | `floatingObjects.ts:29` rect-only exclusion; `wp:wrapPolygon` never consumed |
| **Floating tables (`tblpPr`)** overlap following text; spurious blank pages | `index.ts:584`; `01-fidelity-gaps.md:130-134` |
| ~~**Justified text** uses browser CSS justify~~ **OVER-STATED (12th deflated, 2026-06-21)** — verified: non-last lines fill the full content width (`text-align: justify`), last line stays ragged, matching Word. Breaking on natural widths then justifying is correct (Word does the same); only the break-point *algorithm* (greedy vs Knuth-Plass) differs subtly. | `renderParagraph.ts:1036-1051` |
| ~~**Non-decimal list numbering** falls back to decimal~~ **OVER-STATED (11th deflated, 2026-06-21)** — `formatCounter` (`toFlowBlocks.ts:306`) handles upper/lowerRoman, upper/lowerLetter, decimalZero, ordinal(+Text), cardinalText, hex, chicago, enclosed-circle/paren, none. Only rare CJK/Hebrew/Arabic/Thai/Korean script formats fall to decimal (need lookup tables; in no fixture). | `layout-bridge/toFlowBlocks.ts:306` |
| **Column balancing** (continuous section) not implemented | `01:179` (GH #182) |
| **Oversized header** clips instead of overflowing into margin | `01:120` |
| **TOC tab leaders** — CSS-border approximation, not Word dot-fill metric | `renderParagraph.ts:367-404` |

Genuinely correct: page size/margins, section breaks (continuous/nextPage/even/odd), `keepNext`/`keepLines`, paragraph-spacing margin-collapse, multi-column flow, square wrap, line-spacing rules, footnote reservation.

### 1.4 Top 5 "this looks broken/patched" gaps
1. Page breaks land on different lines than Word (font substitution + no widow/orphan).
2. Anchored shapes/textboxes in the wrong place.
3. Floating images don't wrap tightly.
4. Tables overlapping following text / spurious blank pages.
5. Justified text and TOC leaders look off.

**Key files:** `layout-bridge/measuring/measureContainer.ts`, `utils/fontResolver.ts`, `layout-engine/{paginator,floatingObjects,keep-together,index}.ts`, `layout-painter/{renderTextBox,renderParagraph}.ts`, `scripts/{roundtrip-audit,compare-fidelity}.mjs`, `e2e/{visual.spec.ts,tests/visual-regression.spec.ts}`.

## 2. Co-editing round-trip fidelity — plausibly-to-definitely broken, and unproven

**Most serious finding.** The "39/39 pristine" number covers single-client local save only.

### 2.1 Preserved OOXML never enters the CRDT
The raw-XML envelopes (the basis of the VML/textbox fidelity wins) live as `rawXml?`/`envelopeKey?` on the **Document model's** `Image`/`Shape` (`types/content.ts:499,508,814,819`). They are **dropped at the ProseMirror boundary**:
- `prosemirror/conversion/toProseDoc.ts` `convertImage` (1526), `convertShape` (1840) — never copy `rawXml`/`envelopeKey` into PM attrs.
- `fromProseDoc.ts` `createImageRun` (799), `createShapeRun` (956) — never restore them.

So envelopes exist only on the parsed model held by `DocumentAgent` (seeded from the original `.docx`) + the bytes in `doc.originalBuffer`. **Not in the ProseMirror tree.**

### 2.2 y-prosemirror therefore can't sync them
`react/src/collab/useCollab.ts:87-88` syncs only `ydoc.getXmlFragment('prosemirror')` (+ a `meta` map with `fileName`). The Y.Doc carries **only the PM tree**.

> Correction (verified 2026-06-19 against `backend/`): the earlier claim that the
> backend is a "pure relay with no Y.Doc, no seeding, no snapshot" is **imprecise**.
> The room manager *does* have seed / room-lifecycle / lock / drain scaffolding and
> a `host.Snapshot(docID, token, contents)` interface (`internal/host/host.go:106`).
> What's actually true and decisive: **there is no server-side serializer**. The
> drain hook is `DrainFunc(docID string)` — docID only, no contents — and the wired
> impl (`cmd/gateway/main.go:846`) is a deliberate **no-op** whose own comment says
> *"the gateway can't re-serialize the Y.Doc back to .docx without a worker pool
> (M2 / Bun headless serializer)."* There is no Go CRDT dependency, the room does
> **not** accumulate Y.Doc update bytes, and server-side serialization was removed
> in the M2 pivot (`d24deaa`). So persistence is 100% client-push today; the server
> keeps only the original seed for re-seeding the next join. The §2.4 "no
> server-side snapshot" conclusion stands — for the right reason.

### 2.3 Why fidelity survives at all — a fragile trick
Each joiner independently fetches and parses the seed `.docx` (`CollabApp` passes `documentBuffer={seed.buffer}`, **not** `externalContent`), so each agent has its own `originalBuffer` + envelopes. Save (`DocxEditor.tsx:5723-5793`):
1. `getDocument()` (envelopes + originalBuffer)
2. **overwrites** `content` with `pmDoc.content` (5737) — PM-derived, no `rawXml`
3. `toBuffer` → `attemptSelectiveSave` (`DocumentAgent.ts:675`)

Fidelity holds **only** because selective save (`docx/selectiveSave.ts:104-118`) patches just `changedParaIds` into the original bytes; unchanged paragraphs keep original bytes verbatim, envelopes included. **Full repack (`rezip.ts:476` `serializeDocument`) rebuilds the entire body from the envelope-stripped model → every drawing's envelope regenerated and lost.**

Full repack is forced when (`DocxEditor.tsx:5754-5775`): any structural change, a changed paragraph without a `paraId`, OR any non-paragraph block change (image/shape/textbox/table) — also any new image/hyperlink (`selectiveSave.ts:93`). The change tracker counts **remote ySync transactions too** (`ParagraphChangeTrackerExtension.ts`, no origin filter), so a peer editing a textbox/image pushes the *saving* peer into full repack → envelope loss.

### 2.4 Propagation makes it permanent
Whichever client autosaves (`useFileSourceAutoSave.ts:79` `ref.save({selective:true})`) writes canonical bytes back via `Snapshot`/`PutFile`. If that client was in full-repack, the **stripped version becomes the new stored seed for all future joiners**. Loss is permanent and propagates.

### 2.5 Seed-less save loses fidelity (corrected)
`useCollab.ts` documents hosts to pass `externalContent={true}`; the joiner then
never parses the seed (`DocxEditor.tsx:2613`) and has no `originalBuffer`.
**Correction (verified against source):** this does *not* crash. The save path is
`DocumentAgent.toBuffer()` (`agent/DocumentAgent.ts:675-695`), which falls back to
`createDocx()` (full from-scratch serialize) when `originalBuffer` is absent. The
real cost is **fidelity, not a throw**: a from-scratch serialize rebuilds the body
from the PM-derived model, dropping the preserved raw-XML envelopes (§2.1-2.4) —
exactly the silent-loss path. So the bug is "seed-less collab save degrades
fidelity," which is the Phase 2 work, not a Phase 1 crash. (`rezip.ts:435` only
throws if `repackDocx` is called *directly* without a buffer — the editor never
does; it routes through `toBuffer`.)

### 2.6 Zero coverage
- `e2e/tests/comment-id-collision.spec.ts` — two instances, **not** connected via real Y.Doc/WS; asserts comment-ID ranges.
- `backend/cmd/gateway/broadcast_test.go` — relays frames with placeholder `[]byte("seed")`; no docx, no serialization.
- All `*-roundtrip` tests are single-client local. **None involve Yjs, two peers, or the seed-download path.**

**Risk ranking:** text-only edits in `paraId` paragraphs → safe. Any drawing/table/structural edit → high-risk silent envelope loss. `externalContent={true}` → definitely broken (throws). No server-side Y.Doc→.docx snapshot anywhere → persistence rides entirely on client push.

**Key files:** `react/src/collab/useCollab.ts`, `backend/internal/room/manager.go:374`, `backend/internal/yws/protocol.go`, `prosemirror/conversion/{toProseDoc.ts:1526,1840,fromProseDoc.ts:799,956}`, `docx/{selectiveSave.ts,rezip.ts:433-532}`, `components/DocxEditor.tsx:5723-5793,2611-2623`, `examples/vite/src/App.tsx:917-995`.

## 3. Editing experience — janky by architecture, not by patches

### 3.1 Root cause
**The visible page is static, custom-painted DOM marked `aria-hidden="true"`; the real ProseMirror is parked off-screen at `left:-9999px`** (`paged-editor/HiddenProseMirror.tsx:145-160`, `PagedEditor.tsx:4194`). Caret/selection are simulated `<div>` overlays (`SelectionOverlay.tsx:64-156`) positioned by PM→layout mapping; clicks are pixel→PM lookups (`ClickPositionResolver.ts`). This buys pixel-perfect pagination and bills every native contenteditable affordance back with interest.

### 3.2 Findings
- **IME/CJK — broken by design.** Candidate window renders at the off-screen contenteditable. **Zero** `compositionstart/update/end` handlers; only a `!isComposing` space-key band-aid (`PagedEditor.tsx:3866`, added for Hangul double-space). Non-Latin users can't really write.
- ~~**Typing latency 500ms–2s/keystroke on large docs.**~~ **OVER-STATED (verified
  2026-06-19).** Measured on real hardware (300-page fixture): **start-of-doc
  avg 115ms / max 150ms; mid- and end-of-doc 33ms; undo/redo ~90ms.** That is
  fine (33ms ≈ 30fps; a one-off 115ms at the very top of a 300-page doc is
  acceptable). The "533–868ms / 2000ms threshold" is a **CI-only artifact** —
  the 2-vCPU GitHub runner is heavily throttled; the comment at
  `performance-large-docs.spec.ts:138-141` says exactly that. The "~30-50× Google
  Docs" claim was measuring CI throttling, not the editor. The full-document
  re-measure does exist but the paragraph-measure cache keeps it cheap; not a
  real-world problem. (5th over-stated audit claim deflated this session.)
- **Collab undo three-way collision.** `createStarterKit()` always adds `prosemirror-history` (`StarterKit.ts:108`); collab also adds `yUndoPlugin()` (`useCollab.ts:88`); native history is **never disabled** in collab → undo can revert *other users'* changes. Plus a third React snapshot layer (`useDocumentHistory`, `DocxEditor.tsx:1874`).
- **Caret/selection are faked overlays** decoupled from the text node; accuracy depends on the position→pixel map staying in sync with async relayout. ~~selection math lazy-`import()`s on every change → first-selection flicker~~ **First-selection flicker / per-change frame-lag FIXED (`c299543`, 2026-06-20):** `layout-bridge` is now imported once at module load (chunk warm before first click) and the resolved module cached, so the effect computes caret/selection synchronously instead of a microtask late. The deeper faked-overlay/async-relayout architecture is unchanged.
- **Paste:** Google Docs path exists (`PasteStyleInlinerExtension.ts`). ~~no Word-specific path → mangled spacing/lists~~
  - **List paste FIXED (`e61f650`, 2026-06-20):** `<li>` parseDOM rule + `convertWordLists` (`mso-list`) now produce real list paragraphs (numPr), and `transformPasted` keeps the first item's marker; covered by `e2e/tests/list-paste.spec.ts`.
  - **"Mangled spacing" OVER-STATED (verified 2026-06-20, 9th deflated claim).** Pasting a representative Word-for-Windows clipboard fragment (MsoNormal `margin-bottom:10pt`, `mso-spacerun`, `<o:p>`, `StartFragment`) renders correctly: 10pt after-spacing → 13.33px gaps, the spacerun's runs of spaces survive, the intentional empty `<o:p>` paragraph is kept, Calibri font carries over. The only residual is the leading pasted paragraph losing its block spacing when it merges into the (empty) cursor paragraph — the standard ProseMirror paste merge, correct for mid-sentence paste and deliberately NOT generalised from the list fix.
  - paste-as-plain-text already exists (`pasteAsPlainText` action, see Phase 1).
- **Accessibility — ~~leap of faith~~ core contract now verified (`2bafb96`, 2026-06-20).** Visible doc is `aria-hidden`; the off-screen ProseMirror carries the semantics. Fixed: that contenteditable had no role/name (anonymous edit field, WCAG 4.1.2) → now `role=textbox` + `aria-multiline` + i18n'd `aria-label` (`editor.contentLabel`). `e2e/tests/editor-a11y.spec.ts` pins the contract: visual layer `aria-hidden`, off-screen editor named/typed and NOT buried under an `aria-hidden` ancestor (it's portaled to `<body>`), AT reads the real text. Still open: a full axe-core sweep across dialogs/menus, and focus is still force-recaptured to hidden PM on every interaction (`PagedEditor.tsx:3858-3919`) with documented "focus stealing" pitfalls.

Solid: cross-page selection, table cell nav/merge/resize, list continuation, smart quotes/autocorrect, image paste, internal copy/paste.

### 3.3 Top tech-demo tells
1. IME/CJK effectively unsupported. 2. 500ms–2s large-doc typing latency. 3. Collab undo collision. 4. Faked caret/selection drift under load — first-selection flicker / frame-lag fixed (`c299543`); **deeper async-relayout drift investigated 2026-06-20 and NOT reproducible** (10th deflated claim): on a 30–40-paragraph doc with fast coalesced typing the caret overlay sits pixel-exact on the painted glyph (dx/dy = 0.0px) and immediate==settled per char. The `LayoutSelectionGate.isSafeToRender` guard + the `docChanged`→`useEffect([layout])` deferral keep the overlay from rendering against stale geometry, and `getCaretFromDom` reads the actual painted DOM. No rearchitecture warranted. 5. ~~Word paste mangles + no paste-plain~~ CLOSED — list paste fixed, paste-plain exists, Word spacing verified fine (§3.2). 6. ~~a11y unverified~~ editing-surface named + contract test landed (`2bafb96`); axe sweep + focus-recapture still open. 7. ~~Constant focus recapture~~ investigated (2026-06-20): well-tuned + heavily e2e-covered, NOT a user-facing bug; the real risk was a desync-prone copy-pasted focus-claim, consolidated into one `claimEditorFocus()` path on branch `editing/focus-recapture-rearchitecture` (PR #5, behaviour-preserving, +invariant test).

**Caveat:** input findings are from source + the project's own CI perf numbers + absence of composition handlers; not from live keystroke timing or driving a real IME. Fastest confirmation: load the 300-page fixture and type at the top with the profiler open; type Japanese/Korean and watch the candidate window.

**Key files:** `paged-editor/HiddenProseMirror.tsx`, `PagedEditor.tsx:{1513-1575,3858-3919,3866,4194}`, `SelectionOverlay.tsx`, `ClickPositionResolver.ts`, `StarterKit.ts:108`, `extensions/.../PasteStyleInlinerExtension.ts`, `performance-large-docs.spec.ts`.

## 4. Remediation plan (execution order)

The meta-finding: **you cannot improve visual fidelity while blind.** No harness compares our render to Word, which violates the project's own "never ship UI blind" rule. The instrument comes before the fixes.

### Phase 0 — Measurement (unblocks everything) — BUILT 2026-06-19
Rasterize-and-pixel-diff harness lives in `docx-editor/scripts/visual-fidelity/`
(`run.mjs` orchestrator; `render-editor.mjs` Playwright capture; `render-reference.mjs`
soffice→pdf→png; `diff.py` coarse density-grid score; `composite.py` side-by-side
review images; `README.md`). Renders each fixture in the editor → PNG, renders the
same in LibreOffice → PNG, emits a ranked worst-first score + per-page side-by-side
composites. See the README for the metric's deliberate limits (relative triage proxy,
not pixel parity; **page-count mismatch is the most reliable signal**; when score and
composite disagree, believe the composite).

**Proven on the 5 fixtures that already have reference renders** (`demo`,
`docx-editor-numbering`, `header-with-textbox`, `issue-387-font-theme-override`,
`table-indent`). First real finding: `header-with-textbox` renders **4 pages vs
LibreOffice's 5** — a concrete pagination divergence, exactly the §1.2 failure mode.
Plain-text pages (`demo` p1) match the reference closely, contradicting the harsh
auto-score — which is why the composites, not the number, are authoritative.

#### Phase 0 baseline — full 44-fixture corpus (2026-06-19)

LibreOffice installed; harness run across all 44 fixtures (44 scored).
**Mean 59/100** on the first (buggy-harness) run; **67/100 after the harness
screenshot fix** (see correction below) — distribution then: 12 good (≥85),
9 fair (70-85), 10 poor (50-70), 8 broken (<50), 5 page-count-mismatch. The
+8-point jump was the instrument under-scoring tall/low-content pages, not a
product change. Extremes verified by eye (composites + live DOM probes).

> **Second harness caveat (Phase 3): the score is unreliable on SPARSE pages.**
> `image-hyperlink` (10) and similar near-empty fixtures score low only because
> the density grid is dominated by where a single short line lands — the editor
> render actually matches LibreOffice. Treat low scores on content-sparse
> fixtures as noise; the reliable signals are **page-count mismatch**
> (deterministic) and **content-rich fixtures scoring low** (e.g.
> `medical-incident-form` 30, a dense form — a genuine layout gap). Confirmed
> real bug from this pass: `drawingml-shape` (14) emits a spurious empty-src
> `<img>` (broken-image icon) for a shape-only drawing — see the tracker.

> Correction (post-Phase-1): the first run reported `issue-319-sections` as a
> 0-page **no-render**. That was a **harness flake** — the editor renders it
> fine (11 pages); the screenshotter captured during a layout re-run. Fixed in
> `render-editor.mjs` (wait for the page count to stabilise, not just appear).
> `issue-319` is really a page-count mismatch (11 vs LibreOffice's 8), not a
> render failure.

The signal is unambiguous and **exactly matches the §1.2-1.3 predictions** — the
editor is strong on text and weak-to-broken on drawings/layout:

| Cluster | Score band | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Plain / styled text, colors, headings | 85-97 (good) | `complex-styles` 94, `styled-content`, `wrap-none-two-seals` 97 — editor render ≈ LibreOffice, sometimes better (inter-run spacing). |
| Tables, borders, page color, sections | 70-85 (fair) | `with-tables`, `between-bar-borders`, `three-section-header`, `page-color` — close, minor drift. |
| **Images / shapes / textboxes** | **0-35 (broken)** | `drawingml-shape` 14, `image-hyperlink` 15, `textbox-test` 33, `wpg-group`, `vml-rect`. The §1.3 anchored-drawing cluster, now quantified. |
| **Real-world forms** | **21-24 (broken)** | `Form025U` 23, `medical-incident-form` 24 — the docs real users bring. |
| **Multi-page pagination** | page-count-mismatch | `sds-anti-t-zh` 18≠16, `header-with-textbox` 4≠5, `find-scroll` 4≠3, `issue-68-large` 312≠313 — §1.2 confirmed. |
| **Hard failures** | 0 | ~~`oversized-header-image` renders a **blank body**~~ — **RETRACTED**, see correction below. |

> **Correction (2026-06-19, Phase 3) — the harness had a false-negative bug.**
> `oversized-header-image` was NOT broken — it renders the body correctly
> (body at 672px ≈ LibreOffice's 659px, verified by live DOM probe ×3 + the
> refreshed composite). The "blank body / 0-score" was a **harness** bug:
> `el.screenshot()` on a `.layout-page` taller than the default 720px viewport

This ranks Phase 3 work directly: fix the broken drawing/forms/header cluster first;
text is already production-grade. `issue-319-sections` (0 pages) is a Phase 1 bug.

Artifacts: `docx-editor/visual-fidelity-out/` (gitignored) — `visual-fidelity-report.md`,
`.json`, and `composites/`. Re-run any time with `node scripts/visual-fidelity/run.mjs`.

**Remaining harness TODO:** wire the JSON into a CI regression gate (fail on
score drop / new page-count mismatch); optional glyph-level registration for a
tighter score; swap LibreOffice → Word PDFs for the strict oracle.

#### Phase 3 progress (2026-06-19) — the real shape of the remaining gap

Working the ranked list with "look/probe before fixing" surfaced that the raw
scores over-stated the number of *bugs*. Findings:

- **Fixed — `drawingml-shape` (14 → 89, `7f7f3fb`).** A real, clear bug: a
  shape-only `<w:drawing>` emitted an empty-src `<img>` (broken-image icon)
  next to the painted shape. One-line parser fix; zero regressions. The kind of
  crisp defect worth chasing.
- **Not bugs — `image-hyperlink` (10), and other sparse pages.** Metric noise:
  near-empty pages score low because the density grid is dominated by one short
  line. The editor matches LibreOffice. (Harness caveat, noted above.)
- **The dominant remaining gap is SYSTEMIC vertical-spacing drift, not
  per-fixture bugs.** `medical-incident-form` (30), `textbox-test` (46),
  `EP_ZMVZ_MULTI_v4` (43), `float-wrap` (45), `sds-anti-t-zh` (40, 18≠16 pp)
  all render their *content correctly* (forms, text boxes, fills, borders match)
  — they score low because the editor packs content slightly tighter than
  LibreOffice and the offset **accumulates down the page** (and tips long docs
  into page-count mismatches). This is the §1.2 line-height / paragraph-spacing /
  empty-paragraph-height / table-row-height metrics model — the audit's
  make-or-break, and the hardest category. (The earlier "textboxes render well /
  weak spot is just spacing" read here was itself over-stated: the real-world
  trackers later found genuine VML textbox/group parse drops and systemic
  anchored-object flow-spacing overlap — see [[19-content-drops-and-inconsistencies]]
  A1/A2 and [[20-overlap-and-interaction]] B1/B2/B4.)

**Update — rigorous diagnosis (per-element drift, PyMuPDF ref-Y vs editor
DOM-Y) narrowed it.** It is NOT a global metric:

- **Plain-text line-height is already correct** — editor 21.16px vs LibreOffice
  21.2px on `demo`. So the §1.3 ascent/descent-approximation worry does *not*
  manifest as a line-height error, and "fix the global line-height" is the wrong
  move. (This also lowers the Word-divergence risk: text metrics are sound.)
- **The dominant form-drift factor was CHECKBOX ROW HEIGHTS — ROOT-CAUSED & FIXED
  (`da8943c`, 2026-06-20, branch `fidelity/table-row-height-11`).** A controlled
  LibreOffice experiment (vary the source, re-render) proved the row height is
  driven by the **checkbox cell's font size**, NOT `trHeight`: a 16pt
  `w14:checkbox` (Wingdings 2) row is 75px in LibreOffice, 35px at 11pt, and
  unchanged when `trHeight` is removed. The editor substitutes a Unicode `☐` in a
  normal font → ~34px rows → every form compresses. Fix: `fontResolver` now
  carries a calibrated `singleLineRatio` (~3.3) for Wingdings/Wingdings 2/3 +
  Webdings, and `toProseDoc` keeps the dingbat font name on translated symbol
  glyphs so the measurer applies it (still rendering the safe glyph). Result:
  checkbox rows now ~78px (ref 75px); p1 aligns closely with LibreOffice.
  Guarded by `e2e/tests/checkbox-row-height.spec.ts`. The coarse density-grid
  score only moved 29.8→30.8 (it under-rewards this), but the composite shows the
  real win. **#11 checkbox driver done.**
- **Secondary (still open):** header/logo pushes the title down ~70px — the
  remaining medical-form offset and the main thing still dragging its score.
  Distinct root cause (header/anchored-logo layout), tracked separately.

So the "systemic spacing" work is really **targeted table cell/row-height fixes**,
not a metrics-model rewrite — and verifiable against LibreOffice without needing
a Word oracle (text metrics already match).

#### Phase 3 conclusion (2026-06-19): the product is in far better shape than the scores implied

The single most important Phase-3 finding: **most "broken" scores were NOT
product bugs.** Working the ranked list with look-then-probe discipline, the
"broken" cluster decomposed as:

- **Real, fixed bugs (only 2):** `drawingml-shape` empty-src `<img>` (`7f7f3fb`);
  theme-color shape/textbox borders + `lumMod`/`lumOff` (`ec3220c`). Both crisp,
  verified, generalizable.
- **Harness/metric artifacts (many):** the screenshot-stitching false-blank
  (`oversized-header-image`, fixed in `7e66cc0`); sparse-page density-grid noise
  (`image-hyperlink` and similar); colored-box position noise (`float-wrap`).
- **Partly stale §1.3 claims:** square `wrapSquare` text wrap works on the
  synthetic fixtures; but the "floating-image wrap is fully solved" /
  "textboxes render well, CLAUDE.md weak spot is stale" reads here were
  premature. The real-world trackers later found genuine VML textbox/group parse
  drops ([[19-content-drops-and-inconsistencies]] A1/A2) and systemic
  anchored-object flow-spacing overlap ([[20-overlap-and-interaction]] B1/B2/B4)
  — see the conclusion update below.
- **Genuine but ambiguous:** table cell/row heights — editor looks
  content-correct; **LibreOffice appears to over-size** (task #11, needs a Word
  oracle).

**Bottom line (superseded — see below):** on the *synthetic* 44-fixture corpus,
four separate times this phase a "broken" fixture turned out to be a measurement
artifact or a stale claim, not a product defect, and only 2 crisp bugs surfaced
(both fixed). That conclusion held for the synthetic corpus but was
**over-optimistic as a general claim.** Once real-world fixtures
(`sds-anti-t-zh`, `medical-incident-form`, `Form025U`) were driven through the
pipeline, the audit found a batch of genuine visible drops and overlaps that the
synthetic corpus never exercised — catalogued in the authoritative current
trackers [[19-content-drops-and-inconsistencies]] (A1 nested VML groups, A2
textbox position, A4 inline-shape anchor, A5 line numbers) and
[[20-overlap-and-interaction]] (B1 logo overlap, B2 SDS hazard-box overlap, B5
image-move). Several are fixed (PRs #10–#11, #16); B1/B2/B4 reduced to one
systemic anchored-object flow-spacing problem and the SDS 18≠16 to incomplete
multi-column layout. Treat low scores as triage leads to *verify*, never as
defect counts — and treat docs 19/20 as the live fidelity trackers, not this
section. Remaining true gap worth a dedicated effort: the table-height question
(#11) plus the multi-column / flow-spacing pass in doc 20.

### Phase 1 — Stop the bleeding (correctness bugs, cheap) — DONE 2026-06-19

Verifying each item against source (rule #1) deflated 3 of 4: the fast review
subagents over-stated the bug list. Only one was a real, cheap bug.

- **DONE — collab undo collision (§3.2).** Real. `DocxEditor.tsx` built the
  extension manager with `createStarterKit()` (no options) → native
  `prosemirror-history` always on, even when `externalContent` + `yUndoPlugin`
  drive the doc. Fixed: `createStarterKit(externalContent ? { disable: ['history'] } : {})`.
- **ALREADY IMPLEMENTED — paste-as-plain-text.** The audit claimed it was
  missing; it is not. `DocxEditor.tsx:3190` wires `Mod+Shift+V` (reads the
  clipboard as plain text, inserts via `execCommand`), with the matching Edit-menu
  action (`pasteAsPlainText`) and the `PasteSpecialDialog`. No work needed; a
  regression e2e test is the only gap.
- **NOT A BUG AS AUDITED — `externalContent` save (§2.5).** The audit said
  `repackDocx` "throws outright / no save at all" with no `originalBuffer`.
  False: the editor saves via `DocumentAgent.toBuffer()` (`agent/DocumentAgent.ts:675`),
  which **falls back to `createDocx()`** (full from-scratch serialize) when
  `originalBuffer` is absent — no throw. The genuine concern (a collab joiner
  saving without the original seed loses round-trip *fidelity*, vs *crashing*)
  is the "where do save bytes come from" problem → **moved to Phase 2.**
- **NOT AN EDITOR BUG — `issue-319` 0 pages.** Harness flake (see Phase 0
  correction). Fixed in the harness, not the editor.

### Phase 2 — Co-editing fidelity (highest correctness risk)
- Get preserved OOXML into the synced model or a synced side-channel so envelopes survive collaborative full-repack (§2.1-2.4).
- Add the missing open → two-peer co-edit → save → roundtrip test.
- Decide client-push vs server-side Y.Doc→.docx snapshot.

### Phase 3 — Visual fidelity (ranked by Phase 0)
Font-metric strategy (ship/embed real Office metrics), widow/orphan, anchored-shape positioning, tight wrap — in the order the pixel-diff says matters.

### Phase 4 — Editing feel (deepest)
Incremental relayout for large docs; IME (may require revisiting the off-screen-PM architecture). Scope separately.

## 5. What this does NOT change

The data layer is genuinely strong; round-trip is real. New-feature work (modern/block mode, etc. from the Univer comparison) stays **deprioritized behind this** per the user's directive: fix and harden what exists to production grade before adding surface area.
