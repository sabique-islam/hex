# 00 — Overview

## Goal

A real-time collaborative `.docx` editor service. Browser-side: a fork of `eigenpal/docx-editor` (MIT, React + ProseMirror with OOXML-preserving model). Backend: the shared **Node/TypeScript** collab server **`@casualoffice/collab`** (Hocuspocus + Yjs on Fastify, Apache-2.0) — a stateless, format-agnostic server, also powering Casual Sheets, that holds one authoritative `Y.Doc` per room and produces snapshots/versioning. Document persistence is a pluggable host backend (`memory` / `local` / `s3` / `postgres` / WOPI).

> **Backend note (current).** Real-time sync/presence/snapshots are owned by the Node
> `@casualoffice/collab` server (Hocuspocus + Yjs on Fastify); the editor connects via
> `HocuspocusProvider` (`packages/react/src/collab/useCollab.ts`). A legacy in-repo **Go**
> y-websocket gateway under `backend/` predated this and was **removed 2026-06-28** — all
> sync / persistence / REST work lives in the collab server. The
> "Architecture (committed)", "Decisions (locked, 2026-05-16)", "Resolved questions", and the
> Go-specific milestone rows **below are a historical record of that legacy gateway**. For the
> current backend see [23-collab-server-migration](23-collab-server-migration.md) and
> [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Why this shape

- `.docx` fidelity is hard for standard CRDT editors (ProseMirror/TipTap/Lexical/etc.) because they have no layout engine for page breaks / sections / headers / footers. Eigenpal solves this with a "canonical OOXML" model + a separate `layout-painter` pipeline distinct from ProseMirror's `toDOM`.
- We need realtime co-editing. Eigenpal exposes `externalContent` + `externalPlugins` for `y-prosemirror`'s `ySyncPlugin`, so Yjs is a documented integration path.
- MIT licensing throughout the editor avoids the AGPL boundary work that an OnlyOffice-based plan would require.
- WOPI is the standard protocol for document hosts (SharePoint, Nextcloud, Box, etc.) to expose storage to editor services. Delegating to WOPI means we never own a doc; we only orchestrate concurrent editing.

## Architecture (committed)

```
Browser
   <DocxEditor> (our fork of eigenpal/docx-editor)
        ↕  y-prosemirror.ySyncPlugin
   Y.Doc
        ↕  y-websocket protocol
   Go backend (stateless, in backend/)
        ├─ WS gateway (backend/internal/yws)
        ├─ Room manager — one in-memory Y.Doc per active session
        ├─ host.Integration interface (backend/internal/host)
        │    ├─ inline   — in-process map (v0 share-link flow)
        │    ├─ personal — per-user bcrypt+SQLite auth (Phase C, shipped)
        │    ├─ wopi     — full WOPI HTTP + Lock/Unlock (Phase D, shipped)
        │    └─ jwtapi   — JWT-secured REST (future)
        └─ Snapshot → host (Y.Doc → .docx)
                                ├─ client-push: DocxEditorRef.save() bytes (shipped path)
                                └─ host save:   inline stash / wopi PutFile
```

## Stateless invariant

- No database in the backend.
- No on-disk update log.
- Only state: in-memory Y.Doc per active session.
- When the last client of a doc disconnects, the in-memory Y.Doc is snapshotted via `host.Integration.PutFile` and dropped.
- On process restart, the active room set is empty; clients re-upload (or the host re-seeds via GetFile in the WOPI path).

This shifts the durability story entirely to the host. We become a pure realtime orchestrator.

## Decisions (locked, 2026-05-16)

| Decision | Value | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Editor | Fork of `eigenpal/docx-editor` (MIT) | OOXML fidelity + MIT + active maintenance |
| CRDT | Yjs + `y-prosemirror` | Documented integration in eigenpal's PROPS.md; standard rich-text CRDT path |
| Backend language | Go | IO-bound workload, mature WS ecosystem, fast time-to-v0 |
| Backend state | Stateless (in-memory Y.Doc per session only) | User directive: editor and orchestrator only, no storage |
| WS protocol | **Own implementation in Go**, not a Hocuspocus bridge | ~120 LOC of binary protocol; removes a Node sidecar hop; aligns with stateless invariant. Resolved in [`05-backend-design.md`](05-backend-design.md). |
| Persistence | Pluggable `host.Integration` (`inline` / `wopi` / `jwtapi`) | v0 is self-contained via the inline host; v1+ slots into existing storage stacks. |
| WOPI target | **Own mock first**, then a real host | Decouples protocol bring-up from host-specific debugging. Resolved in [`05-backend-design.md`](05-backend-design.md). |
| Cross-node fanout | **Sticky routing per docId** for v0 | Revisit Redis pubsub only when a single Go process can't hold the active-doc working set in RAM. |
| Licensing | MIT on the editor fork, Apache-2.0 on the Go backend | Pivot eliminated the previous AGPL boundary; the backend was always greenfield. |
| AGPL `agent-use` | Removed from fork | User directive — no AGPL code in the editor path. |
| GitHub | `CasualOffice/docs` (editor + backend in one repo) | Org-renamed from the original solo handle; push target `git@github.com:CasualOffice/docs.git`. |

## Resolved questions

- ~~Write our own y-websocket-protocol implementation in Go, or bridge to a Hocuspocus-equivalent?~~ **Built our own** (`backend/internal/yws/protocol.go`).
- ~~WOPI integration target — start with our own mock for testing, or integrate against a real host (Nextcloud, etc.) first?~~ **Inline host first** for the v0 share-link flow; full WOPI integration has since shipped end-to-end (Phase D, D1–D5).
- ~~Cross-node fanout if/when we scale past one backend node — Redis pubsub or stick with single-node-per-doc routing?~~ **Sticky routing by docId** for v0.
- ~~Text-box fidelity gap in the editor.~~ Done. Tracked at scale across the per-tag round-trip audit (`docx-editor/scripts/roundtrip-audit.mjs`).

## Open questions

- Bundle size and TTFI on the editor — benchmark after first integration test.
- **Server-side snapshot-on-drain fallback** — M2 snapshot shipped via client-side push (`DocxEditorRef.save()` + `useFileSourceAutoSave`, `d24deaa`); the earlier Bun-worker-pool plan was explicitly dropped to keep Bun out of the production image. The only open piece is a server-side serializer for the rare case where no client is around to push a final save (deprioritised; tracked in [`18-server-snapshot-design.md`](18-server-snapshot-design.md)).
- **Real-world visual fidelity** — round-trip is pristine (39/39); the live focus is rendering correctly on real documents (`sds-anti-t-zh`, `medical-incident-form`, `Form025U`). Tracked authoritatively in [`19-content-drops-and-inconsistencies.md`](archive/19-content-drops-and-inconsistencies.md) (content drops) and [`20-overlap-and-interaction.md`](archive/20-overlap-and-interaction.md) (overlap/interaction).

## What this is not

- Not a multi-format editor — `.docx` only. Spreadsheets and presentations are out of scope (Casual Sheets is a sibling project — see status below).
- Not building a CRDT from scratch — Yjs is chosen.
- Not running OnlyOffice's Document Server.
- **Not a storage system.** Storage = host. We orchestrate live editing only.

## Sibling project — Casual Sheets

`CasualOffice/casual-sheets` (`services/sheet/` in the local workspace) is the spreadsheet half of the same product family. Same operator, same self-host story, deliberately parallel shape so the two services slot into one deployment.

### Current state (cross-project audit)

| | Casual Editor (this repo) | Casual Sheets |
|---|---|---|
| **Released version** | unreleased (M1 backend + client-push snapshot shipped) | **v0.1.0** — first version-bumped release |
| **Editor base** | Fork of `eigenpal/docx-editor` (MIT) + custom layout-painter | Univer OSS 0.24.x (Apache-2.0) + custom Office-style chrome |
| **CRDT** | Yjs + `y-prosemirror`, shared Node `@casualoffice/collab` (Hocuspocus + Yjs) | Yjs + Hocuspocus (Node) — same server |
| **Persistence** | `host.Integration` interface; `inline` + per-user `personal` (Phase C) + `wopi` (Phase D) all shipped | Same interface shape; **4 backends shipped** — `memory` · `local` · `s3` (AWS/MinIO/R2/B2) · `postgres` |
| **WOPI / JWT** | **Shipped** (Phase D) — WOPI client, JWKS JWT verifier, embed redirect, `WopiFileSource`, `host.Locker` Lock/Unlock/RefreshLock; Personal auth (Phase C) JWT/session shipped too | **Shipped** — CheckFileInfo / GetFile / PutFile + JWT claims (role / permissions / features / per-file lateral guard) |
| **Admin panel** | `casual-docs` CLI + `/admin/users` routes (Phase C Batch 5) | Shipped — `/admin`, env-gated, 7 sections (branding · storage · networking · room limits · auth · webhooks · base path) |
| **Webhooks** | None | 9 events, HMAC-SHA256 (`X-Casual-Signature: sha256=<hex>`), single retry |
| **Self-host docs** | Outer docs under `docs/` | 11 pages live on the Sheets docs site |
| **Fidelity** | 39/39 round-trip pristine (≥ 90 % floor cleared); live focus is real-world visual fidelity (docs 19/20) | xlsx + ods round-trip + 54/54 pivot-cache passthrough |
| **Test coverage** | ~340 e2e + targeted unit suites | 357 e2e + 60 unit |
| **Mobile** | Editor + home gallery responsive, pinch-zoom, mobile format chip | Viewer + light editor down to ~360 px; sticky bottom action bar |
| **Live deploy** | `doc.schnsrw.live` (single-user demo) | `sheet.schnsrw.live` (single-user demo) |

### Why it matters here

Sheets led on the platform side and Document has since closed most of the gap (M2 snapshot via client push, Phase C personal auth, Phase D WOPI all shipped). Patterns still worth lifting:

- **`host.Integration` shape** — Sheets' four concrete backends cover the same surface Document's interface will expose; the Postgres + S3 modules can be ported with minor renames.
- **JWT claims model** — `sub` · `file_id` · `role` · per-flag `permissions` · `features` · `password_required` · `display_name`. The lateral-access guard (URL `:id` must match `file_id` claim → 403) is the right default — Document should adopt it verbatim.
- **Admin panel structure** — 7-section JSON config persisted at 0600, secrets redacted on read with a `***` sentinel that preserves the prior verbatim on write-back. Saves us rebuilding the UX.
- **Webhook signing convention** — `X-Casual-Signature: sha256=<hex>`. If Document ships a webhook layer, use the same header so embedders only learn one HMAC verifier.

### Cross-project order of operations

1. ~~**Document M2** (snapshot)~~ — shipped via client-side push (`d24deaa`); server-side drain fallback deprioritised ([`18-server-snapshot-design.md`](18-server-snapshot-design.md)).
2. ~~**Document M3 / Phase D** (WOPI + JWT host)~~ — shipped end-to-end (D1–D5); Personal-auth host (Phase C) shipped alongside.
3. **Shared admin shell** — once both services have admin needs, decide whether to factor a `@casualoffice/admin-shell` package or run two copies. Defer until the second service actually needs it.
4. **Document M4** (Tauri desktop) — paused per user directive.

This block is informational — concrete dependencies for any given Document milestone live in `05-backend-design.md`.

## Milestone status

| Milestone | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **M0 — Editor fork brought up locally** | ✅ done | Bun toolchain installed; Vite demo at localhost:5173. |
| **M1 — Stateless Go gateway (v0 self-contained)** | ✅ shipped *(historical — Go `backend/` removed 2026-06-28; superseded by the Node `@casualoffice/collab` server)* | `backend/cmd/gateway/main.go` *(deleted)* — POST /api/docs, GET /api/docs/{id}/download, GET /doc/{id} (WS), GET /health. `inline` host backed the v0 flow. Room manager, broadcast, upload, static-SPA path all unit-tested. Sync / persistence / REST now live in `@casualoffice/collab` (see [23-collab-server-migration](23-collab-server-migration.md)). |
| **M2 — Snapshot on drain** | ✅ shipped (client-push) | `DocxEditorRef.save()` produces the `.docx` bytes client-side; `useFileSourceAutoSave` pushes them through `FileSource.save()` (`d24deaa`). The original Bun-worker-pool-on-drain plan was **explicitly dropped** to keep Bun out of the production image. A server-side serializer remains a deprioritised fallback for the no-client-present case ([`18-server-snapshot-design.md`](18-server-snapshot-design.md)). |
| **Phase C — Personal auth** | ✅ shipped end-to-end | bcrypt + SQLite `UserStore`, signup/login/logout + `/auth/me`, per-user file scoping + CRUD, `Profile` sidecar, `casual-docs` admin CLI + `/admin/users` routes (`backend/internal/auth/personal/`). |
| **Phase D — WOPI (M3)** | ✅ shipped end-to-end | D1 WOPI client + JWKS JWT verifier (alg-confusion defence); D2 `/wopi/host` embed redirect; D3 `WopiFileSource` + token threading; D4 `host.Locker` Lock/Unlock; D5 per-room `RefreshLock` ticker (`backend/internal/host/wopi/`, `backend/internal/auth/wopi/`). |
| **M4 — Tauri desktop binary** | paused | Early scaffolding only. Fidelity floor (≥ 90 %) is now cleared, so M4 is technically *unblocked*, but the user has paused this milestone — do not start the desktop build until they explicitly green-light it. |

## Status (2026-07-19)

Pivot completed 2026-05-16; the project is well past it. Phase C (Personal auth) and Phase D (WOPI) both shipped end-to-end; M2 snapshot ships via client-side push. The in-repo **Go** y-websocket gateway (`backend/`) was **removed 2026-06-28** — all sync / presence / persistence / REST work now lives in the Node/TypeScript `@casualoffice/collab` server (Hocuspocus + Yjs on Fastify), vendored at `./collab`. AGPL code purged from the fork; statelessness preserved (no DB). The editor fork is **inlined** (no separate `.git/`). Recent work: PRs #10–#16, focused on real-world visual fidelity (`sds-anti-t-zh`, `medical-incident-form`, `Form025U`), tracked in [`19-content-drops-and-inconsistencies.md`](archive/19-content-drops-and-inconsistencies.md) and [`20-overlap-and-interaction.md`](archive/20-overlap-and-interaction.md).

**Editor side:**
- Round-trip audit harness — eliminated ~2,400 dropped tags across 16+ commits.
- 19 → 26 → **39 / 39 fixtures round-trip pristine**. The ≥ 90 % desktop-ship floor is cleared. VML cluster closed via raw-XML envelope capture in `302c210`. **The live focus is now real-world visual fidelity** (content drops + overlap/interaction on real documents), tracked authoritatively in docs 19 and 20 — not the round-trip count.
- Header textboxes (DrawingML + VML), wpg:wgp groups with child positioning, w:sym Wingdings glyphs, theme-color round-trip, multi-section sectPr, paragraph between/bar borders, list multi-indent, table merged cells (gridSpan + vMerge), table indent offset, header-image inheritance, find-replace scroll, image hyperlinks, file-properties dialog, export-as-PDF, drawing-shapes (modern + VML).
- **Home page (this week)** — template gallery with 14 real .docx templates (Resume, Cover letter, Letter, Meeting notes, Project proposal, Memo, Weekly status, Press release, Travel itinerary, Recipe, Essay, Lab report, Course syllabus, Sample), 4 categories, real first-page PNG previews from LibreOffice. Title-bar logo click confirms + returns to home (Google Docs pattern). 8/8 home-page e2e specs pass.
- **#395 Word-compat closing border (this week)** — opt-in `wordCompat` flag plumbed through `RenderContext` / `PainterOptions` / `RenderPageOptions`. 5 unit tests cover on/off + skip paths. Renderer-only for now; no UI surface.
- **CI green-up** — three sweeps fixed stale e2e selectors (list/indent aria-labels gained shortcut chips; broadened file `accept`; hyperlinks "New" button moved into File dropdown; help-menu URL points at the `CasualOffice` org; demo-docx fidelity tests wrapped in `expect.poll` to avoid race conditions).
- **Live editor features** — the writing assistant (`src/lib/writer`, `AISuggestionPanel`, `WritingAssistantSheet`) and the embed/iframe SDK (`src/embed/protocol.ts`, `@casualoffice/docs` package) are shipped and live.

**Backend side (current — Node `@casualoffice/collab`):**
- Realtime sync / presence / snapshots / REST (`/api/rooms`, `/auth`, `/files`, `/wopi`) are owned by the Node/TypeScript `@casualoffice/collab` server (Hocuspocus + Yjs on Fastify), vendored at `./collab`, which also serves the bundled SPA. See [23-collab-server-migration](23-collab-server-migration.md).
- M1's stateless **Go** gateway (`backend/`) shipped the v0 flow but was **removed 2026-06-28** — historical; see milestone table above.
- Three-way fidelity harness in CI: us vs LibreOffice vs OnlyOffice DocumentBuilder.

**Infrastructure:**
- CI + GitHub Pages deploy live at [doc.schnsrw.live](https://doc.schnsrw.live/).
- Casual Editor branding throughout (logo, favicon, README, demo page).
