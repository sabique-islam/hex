## 2026-07-19 — Production-readiness audit + hardening pass

A 14-dimension multi-agent audit (7 engineering + 7 UX), each finding code-cited and
spot-verified against source. Headline: **57/100** — production-capable for single-user
desktop, but gated below that by release-blocking data-loss and security defects in the
intended multi-user / WOPI configuration. Full narrative + roadmap live in the audit
artifact; the concrete gates and their status are tracked here.

### Release gates (must close before a multi-user / WOPI production release)

| # | Gate | Severity | Status |
| - | ---- | -------- | ------ |
| 1 | Collab autosave overwrites the stored `.docx` with a blank doc before Y.Doc sync | critical | **Fixed 2026-07-19** — `useCollab` exposes `synced`; `useFileSourceAutoSave` gains an `isReady()` gate; editor is never serialized pre-sync (`useFileSourceAutoSave.test.ts`) |
| 2 | Two stored/paste XSS vectors (unvalidated hyperlink href + `innerHTML` on live paste) | high | **Fixed 2026-07-19** — `safeUrl()` scheme allow-list at every href sink + inert `DOMParser` paste (`safeUrl.test.ts`) |
| 3 | WOPI `access_token` leaks in the visible URL + bug-report links; empty-origin embed msgs trusted | medium | **Fixed 2026-07-19** — `stripAccessTokenFromUrl()` on boot; origin+pathname-only report URLs; strict embed origin gate |
| 4 | Personal-mode optimistic concurrency (If-Match) unwired → silent last-write-wins | critical | **Fixed 2026-07-19 (PR #311)** — etag threaded through `useFileSourceAutoSave`; conflict now 412s instead of clobbering |
| 5 | WOPI 409 conflict wedges autosave into permanent silent edit loss | high | **Fixed 2026-07-19 (PR #311)** — 409 adopts host version; hook enters a durable conflict pause instead of infinite stale-retry |
| 6 | Share permissions are an unenforced client-side `?role=` hint; no access UI | high | **Open (Next)** — server-enforced share tokens + collaborator management (overlaps P1.7/P1.9) |
| 7 | Offline edits volatile despite banner promising "saved locally" | high | **Fixed 2026-07-21 (PR #358)** — `IndexeddbPersistence` mirrors the room Y.Doc to IndexedDB; edits survive reload/offline and replay on reconnect. Browser-verified in real Chromium incl. a reload with the WS server **down** (restore can only come from IndexedDB). `synced` still gates on the WS provider, preserving gate 1's blank-doc-overwrite protection |

Feedback follow-ups: **Fixed 2026-07-19 (PR #313)** — manual-save failure toast + no false
"Saved X ago" after a failed autosave (`pendingError` → "Unsaved changes"). Remaining audit
quick-win: unconfirmed comment-thread delete.

**Now-phase status:** all 6 release gates that block a multi-user/WOPI production release are
closed (PRs #310–#313). The safe, verifiable Next-phase slices then shipped as PRs #314–#322
(fidelity-gate coverage, honest offline/share copy, real 2-client convergence net, touch
editing + mobile fit-to-width, content-language a11y, comment-delete confirm, cross-platform
shortcut hints, parse-error recovery) — readiness **57 → 70**.

**Then (2026-07-21):** three hands-on bug reports + a two-agent data-integrity/correctness
audit → every HIGH/MED finding fixed with a regression test (crit data-loss and crash-on-open
repro-confirmed first); the full **`useDocumentIO` decomposition** (load/print/save all in
hooks, #352–#355); and the **roving-tabindex a11y toolbar** (#356). Dimension rises:
correctness 4→5, architecture 2→4, a11y 3→4, security/collaboration held at 4 — readiness
**70 → 81**. Full ledger in the readiness-proof artifact.

**Then (2026-07-21, cont.):** the two remaining browser-verifiable slices shipped —
**offline persistence** (y-indexeddb, gate 7; verified in real Chromium incl. a server-down
reload, #358) and the full **touch selection** story: long-press **drag-select** (#359) plus
draggable **selection handles** (#361), all CDP-touch e2e'd with the desktop path untouched.
Plus a contained fidelity fix — hyperlink text from a wrapped `fldSimple` (#360). Dimension
rises: mobile 3→4, and gate 7 (last durability gate) closed — readiness **81 → 84**.

**Then (2026-07-22):** a 3-agent correctness hunt (undo×collab, IME/composition,
comments+track-changes serialization) + two hands-on bug reports. Shipped, each with a
regression test: **undo/redo was entirely dead in collab** — history disabled there and
y-undo was never bound to a keymap; now Ctrl+Z/Y drive y-prosemirror's local UndoManager,
verified with a real-browser collab e2e (#364). **Comment anchors around hyperlinks** lost on
save/load — index desync vs coalesced hyperlinks + missing `applyCommentMarks` (#363).
In-editor **File→Open of .md/.txt/.rtf/.eml** converted to DOCX instead of routing to the
markdown viewer — new `onOpenSourceFile` host hook (#365). **Header text boxes off-canvas** —
anchor offsets used raw EMUs as px; now `emuToPixels` (#366). **Selective-save re-edit window**
— a paragraph re-edited mid-serialize had its tracker entry cleared, silently dropping the edit;
now retained via `paraIdsSafeToClear` (#367). Dimension: collaboration 4→5 (undo), correctness
held at 5 — readiness **84 → 86**.

**Correctness-hunt findings still open** (assessed, need dedicated design — not quick fixes):
- **Full-repack save re-edit window** (sibling of #367): the non-selective `'clear'` also resets
  the structural/untracked/blockType flags, so protecting re-edited paras via `clearServed` would
  strand `structuralChange=true` (permanent full-repack) or risk dropping an untracked/structural
  window edit. Needs the tracker to model t0-state vs window-delta. MED confidence.
- **Non-collab duplicate document-model Ctrl+Z** (`useHistory`): fires alongside prosemirror-history
  and can desync the save-base; the collab case is fixed (#364) but non-collab remains. Entangled
  with undo of out-of-PM edits (headers/section props). MED.
- **Remote edit mid-IME-composition** can drop in-flight characters (no `view.composing` guard on
  the y-sync apply). MED — needs a real device to verify safely.

**Remaining work** is infra-gated or large & delicate: screenshot suite (Linux runner),
server-enforced share tokens (separate collab repo), 100-page performance (O(doc-size)/keystroke
layout), the off-screen `role=textbox` magnifier a11y fix, soft-keyboard viewport handling, and
the remaining ViewState/Formatting context extraction (assessed as largely lateral churn — the
props are already context-fed via `EditorToolbarContext`, not drilled). The clean,
self-contained, verifiable-in-repo slices are all shipped.

### Status reconciliations (2026-07-19)

Corrected against the doc's own 2026-07-04 audit + collab PR #4:
- **P1.1** (persistent collab storage mandatory in prod) → the `collab-ephemeral-prod` guard shipped (refuses boot on `NODE_ENV=production` + in-memory storage unless `ALLOW_EPHEMERAL`). Remaining prod gap is only `collab-prod-compose-memory` (`REDIS_URL` commented out in prod compose).
- **P1.11** (flush debounced saves on shutdown) → **Covered**: `collab-sigterm-drops-saves` + `collab-no-drain-snapshot` both fixed in collab PR #4.
- Editor `find-not-in-headers` → **Fixed**: `handleFind` now uses `getActiveEditorView()`.

### Docs hygiene (2026-07-19)

Whole-corpus staleness triage (37 docs). Deleted `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` (superseded by
`deploy/README.md`); archived `05-backend-design`, `09-feature-parity-pipeline`, `12-env-vars`,
`16-sdk-iframe-architecture`, `17-production-readiness-audit`; corrected the Go→Node
backend-truth drift and shipped-status drift across 22 docs. This tracker is now the single
live production tracker.

### DocxEditor decomposition (Spec #6) — progress (2026-07-21)

- **Dialog registry** — all 22 modal dialogs on the `useDialogs` reducer registry
  (batches 1–3, #324/#325/#332); download/IO primitives extracted to `utils/download.ts`
  (#326–#329).
- **DialogActionsContext (option 3, #333)** — ~18 dialog-open handlers grouped into one
  context; DocxEditor's `<EditorToolbar>` call site 81 → 63 props. **Non-breaking** —
  `Toolbar`/`ToolbarProps`/`FormattingBar` are published API, so their prop contracts were
  left intact. Verified typecheck + 61 e2e.
- **`useDocumentIO` decomposition — COMPLETE (2026-07-21).** The entire document IO is now
  out of the god-component and in hooks: `useDocumentLoad` (parse/generation-guard/restore,
  #352), `usePrintFlow` (print + Export-as-PDF, #353), and the crown-jewel `useDocumentSave`
  (#355 — a verbatim move of `handleSave` + its two reply-marker helpers, preserving the
  mutation order and the comments-by-value / refs-never-snapshotted invariants). Guarded by a
  new `handleSave` characterization e2e (#354, tracked-change save→reload), the footnote/
  endnote save e2e, the ParagraphChangeTracker unit tests, and the 39-fixture round-trip gate.
- **Still open (dedicated sessions):** ViewState/Formatting/Insert contexts (entangled with
  the controlled/uncontrolled prop pattern — lower value now that IO is out). Specs in
  [40-hardening-followups-specs.md](./40-hardening-followups-specs.md).

### Accessibility (2026-07-21)

- **Roving-tabindex formatting toolbar (#356)** — the WAI-ARIA toolbar keyboard pattern: the
  bar is a single tab stop with Left/Right/Home/End navigation (was ~30 separate tab stops).
  Container-level `useRovingTabindex` hook; verified with a keyboard-nav e2e + 80 regression
  e2e. With content-language (#319), two of the three flagged a11y gaps are closed; only the
  off-screen `role=textbox` magnifier-tracking issue remains.

### Hands-on product bugs (2026-07-21) — all fixed

Found through real use; each root-caused (multi-agent), fixed, and regression-tested:
- **B1 — `.md` open rendered as garbage** → **Fixed (#335)**. The FileSource / home-open path
  fed markdown bytes straight to the DOCX zip parser (the in-editor picker already converted).
  Shared `toDocxBytes()` helper applied at the open boundary; `.docx` still passes through
  with no worker. 6 unit tests + `odt-open` e2e.
- **B2 — watermark missing on some pages of 8+ page docs** → **Fixed (#334)**. The
  incremental-render cache key (`computeOptionsHash`) ignored the watermark, so virtualized
  docs kept stale per-page overlay state. Hash the watermark. 5 unit tests.
- **B3 — text ran off the page** → **Fixed (#336)**. Wrapping used the signed block indent
  (a negative indent *widened* the wrap width) while the renderer clamps negatives to 0.
  Clamp measurement to match. Regression test fails on pre-fix code; 179 layout tests green.
  _Follow-up: renderer honoring negative indents (pull text into the margin) for full Word
  fidelity — the reported defect was the overflow, now fixed._

**Target:** A reliable, polished, production-grade self-hosted office suite where Casual Docs can stand credibly against LibreOffice Writer and OnlyOffice Document Editor, and share one collaboration protocol/server with Casual Sheets and Casual Slides.

This tracker is intentionally strict. A task is not done because the feature appears to work in a demo. A task is done only when the acceptance gate, regression coverage, deployment path, recovery behavior, and user-facing UX are complete.

Status legend:

- **Covered** — code/tests/docs already satisfy the acceptance gate.
- **Partial** — meaningful implementation or tests exist, but the production gate is not fully closed.
- **Todo** — not found in the current codebase or docs audit.
- **Verify** — likely present, but needs a focused run or deeper inspection before marking covered.

---

## Product Standard

The target product must feel like a real office tool:

- Reliable under crash, refresh, network drop, browser close, server restart, and concurrent editing.
- Clean and predictable UI: no debug-feeling controls, no inconsistent dialogs, no hidden critical actions, no confusing states.
- Accessible by default: keyboard, screen reader, high contrast, dark mode, reduced motion, focus visibility, target size, and IME/CJK are part of the release bar.
- Fidelity-first: `.docx` output must not silently damage user documents.
- Operator-friendly: one documented production topology, persistent storage, backups, health checks, metrics, and upgrade path.
- Suite-ready: Docs, Sheets, and Slides use the same collaboration service, auth concepts, sharing semantics, storage contract, and deployment model.

## Architecture Direction

The forward backend is the shared Node/TypeScript `@casualoffice/collab` server:

- Hocuspocus + Yjs on Fastify.
- One authoritative `Y.Doc` per room.
- Format-agnostic room, auth, sharing, snapshot, and persistence primitives.
- Used by Docs, Sheets, and future Slides.
- Stores opaque file bytes and Yjs updates; editor-specific serialization remains in the product clients unless a dedicated headless serializer is introduced.

The legacy Go gateway (`backend/`) was **removed 2026-06-28** (see [23-collab-server-migration](./23-collab-server-migration.md)):

- The collab server now serves the SPA, the REST surface (`/api/rooms`, `/auth`, `/files`, `/wopi`), and the WS broker (`/yjs`) from one origin.
- All realtime / snapshot / REST work lives in the collab server.
- Public docs (README, deploy, `.env.example`, CLAUDE.md, NOTICE) no longer reference the Go gateway.

## Global Release Gates

No production-grade release until all gates below are green.

| Gate           | Required bar                                                                                                                                                                       | Evidence                                                                     |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reliability    | User edits survive refresh, tab close, browser crash simulation, network drop/reconnect, collab server restart, gateway restart, and storage restart within documented guarantees. | E2E + integration tests, manual failure runbook.                             |
| Persistence    | Production deploy refuses or loudly warns on non-persistent collab storage.                                                                                                        | Startup validation + deployment docs + health endpoint.                      |
| Fidelity       | Round-trip stays pristine; visual fidelity floor stays locked; extreme corpus regressions are tracked and blocked when severe.                                                     | Roundtrip audit, visual fidelity CI, fixture corpus report.                  |
| Collaboration  | Two+ peers converge across text, tables, images, comments, track changes, footnotes/endnotes, properties, version history, and strict mode.                                        | Live-server multi-peer Playwright suite.                                     |
| Accessibility  | WCAG 2.2 AA target for app chrome and core workflows; documented exceptions for document content authored by users.                                                                | axe checks, keyboard scripts, contrast audit, manual AT matrix.              |
| UX/UI          | Core workflows are discoverable, consistent, and polished in light/dark themes at desktop and mobile-width shells.                                                                 | UX checklist, screenshots, reviewed flows.                                   |
| Deployment     | One official production topology with reverse proxy, persistent storage, backups, health, logs, and upgrade guidance.                                                              | `deploy/` docs + smoke script.                                               |
| Security       | Share links, roles, view-only enforcement, auth tokens, password handling, upload limits, and CORS/base-path behavior are tested.                                                  | Security test suite + threat checklist.                                      |
| Observability  | Operators can tell whether sync, storage, snapshot, auth, and frontend asset serving are healthy.                                                                                  | `/health`, `/ready`, structured logs, metrics.                               |
| CI consistency | Every change has a trustworthy blast-radius signal: unit, integration, Playwright, visual, fidelity, and deploy smoke failures are deterministic and actionable.                   | Required CI matrix, flake budget, test ownership map, failure triage labels. |

## Phase 0 — Tracker Hygiene And Architecture Truth

**Goal:** Remove ambiguity. Everyone should know that the Node collab server is the forward path.

| ID   | Task                                                                             | Acceptance gate                                                                                                                            | Status                                                                                                                  |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P0.1 | Update README architecture claims from Go/y-websocket to Node/Hocuspocus collab. | README stack table, collaboration section, Docker section, and API surface no longer contradict `deploy/README.md`.                        | Todo                                                                                                                    |
| P0.2 | Mark legacy Go realtime gateway as transitional everywhere.                      | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `00-overview.md`, deployment docs, and Docker comments consistently describe current vs legacy responsibilities.   | Done — the Go gateway was removed 2026-06-28 (#195); README, deploy, `.env.example`, CLAUDE.md, NOTICE, Docker all collab-only. |
| P0.3 | Define the official production topology.                                         | One canonical diagram: `gateway/static + collab + persistent storage + reverse proxy`; single-container legacy path labeled dev/demo only. | Covered — `deploy/README.md`, `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`, and `deploy/Caddyfile` define gateway + collab + proxy. |
| P0.4 | Add a decision record for “one shared collab server across Docs/Sheets/Slides.”  | Decision states why: shared protocol, fewer servers, common auth/share semantics, common operator story.                                   | Partial — `23-collab-server-migration.md` covers Docs/Sheets; formal suite-wide ADR still useful.                       |
| P0.5 | Create a release checklist template.                                             | Every release must attach gate status: fidelity, collab, a11y, UX, security, deploy, rollback.                                             | Todo                                                                                                                    |

**Exit criteria:** Public-facing docs, internal docs, and deployment docs tell the same story.

## Phase 1 — Production Collaboration Foundation

**Goal:** Make shared Node/Hocuspocus collaboration the reliable default, not a migration experiment.

| ID    | Task                                                              | Acceptance gate                                                                                                                            | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P1.1  | Make persistent collab storage mandatory for production.          | Server logs fatal or readiness fails when `NODE_ENV=production` and storage is in-memory, unless an explicit unsafe override is set.       | Todo — actual code uses in-memory Y.Doc storage unless `REDIS_URL` is set (`collab/src/storage.ts`). `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` sets `CASUAL_STORAGE=local`, but that only selects workbook file storage via `createHost()`. |
| P1.2  | Define storage backend contract for Y.Doc snapshots.              | `memory`, `local`, `s3`, `postgres`, and Redis/Yjs snapshot storage have documented durability, TTL, backup, and recovery guarantees.      | Partial — workbook host backends are memory/local/s3/postgres; Y.Doc storage is only memory/Redis and Redis has a 7-day idle TTL. Docs currently blur these two storage systems.                                                   |
| P1.3  | Add collab health and readiness checks.                           | Readiness separately reports HTTP, Hocuspocus upgrade, storage load/save/delete, auth resolver, and room registry.                         | Partial — `/health` exists with room count; deeper readiness is not complete.                                                                                                                                                      |
| P1.4  | Add same-origin `/yjs` smoke test.                                | Script starts gateway + collab + proxy, opens two clients, verifies sync, view-only, reconnect, and snapshot reload.                       | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| P1.5  | Add multi-peer Docs convergence tests against real collab server. | Tests cover text, formatting, tables, images, comments, footnotes/endnotes, props, track changes, strict co-editing.                       | Partial — unit transport coverage exists for comments/footnotes/props/strict mode; real live-server Docs e2e still needed.                                                                                                         |
| P1.6  | Add disconnect/reconnect resilience tests.                        | Simulate server restart, WS close, network offline/online, tab reload; peers converge without duplicate/lost content.                      | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| P1.7  | Enforce view-only server-side.                                    | Crafted client cannot mutate a view-only room; test bypasses UI and sends direct Yjs update.                                               | Partial — Hocuspocus `connection.readOnly` is implemented; direct crafted-update test should be added.                                                                                                                             |
| P1.8  | Define room lifecycle rules.                                      | TTL, max rooms, eviction, password/share-token behavior, and persisted-room retention are documented and tested.                           | Covered — `rooms.unit.test.ts` and join-role/share tests cover caps, eviction, protected rooms, tokens, expiry, password checks.                                                                                                   |
| P1.9  | Unify role model across suite.                                    | Docs and Sheets use the same role names, role precedence, share-token binding, and URL parameters.                                         | Partial — collab join-role and personal share APIs are tested; suite-level contract still needs formalization.                                                                                                                     |
| P1.10 | Build collab operational dashboard endpoint.                      | Admin/health output shows room count, connected peers, storage backend, pending saves, and recent errors without leaking document content. | Partial — admin config and `/api/rooms` exist; production-safe ops dashboard is not complete.                                                                                                                                      |
| P1.11 | Flush debounced Y.Doc saves on shutdown.                          | SIGTERM/server close persists every queued room update before destroying Hocuspocus/storage, with a bounded timeout and test.              | Todo — `attachHocuspocus().close()` clears pending save timers but stores only timer handles, so edits inside the 500 ms debounce window can be dropped on shutdown.                                                               |

**Exit criteria:** A production deploy can run collab for Docs with persistent state, tested reconnection, tested view-only enforcement, and no dependency on the legacy Go realtime path.

## Phase 2 — Save, Snapshot, Versioning, And Recovery

**Goal:** User work must survive real failure modes.

| ID   | Task                                                      | Acceptance gate                                                                                                                                 | Status                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P2.1 | Define authoritative save model.                          | Clear spec for client `.docx` bytes, server Y.Doc state, host file bytes, version history, and conflict resolution.                             | Todo                                                                                                                                                       |
| P2.2 | Add crash-safe autosave tests.                            | Browser page crash/reload retains latest acknowledged edits or shows clear recovery UI for pending local edits.                                 | Partial — local autosave restore/banner and autosave indicator tests exist; real browser crash + collab/server recovery gate remains.                      |
| P2.3 | Add pagehide/beforeunload save behavior audit.            | Large docs either save safely before unload or communicate “sync pending” without pretending success.                                           | Partial — `useFileSourceAutoSave` flushes on `visibilitychange` and `pagehide`, with unit coverage; large-doc/server-backed reliability still needs proof. |
| P2.4 | Add host version conflict UX.                             | If `If-Match`/WOPI/local version mismatches, user sees conflict flow, not silent overwrite.                                                     | Partial — backend/collab tests cover stale etag/version mismatch; end-user conflict UX needs verification.                                                 |
| P2.5 | Make version history production-grade.                    | Named versions, auto versions, restore, delete, rename, preview, and diff are tested with collab and storage restart.                           | Partial — version history, audit, preview, and panel layout Playwright tests exist; storage-restart/collab integration remains.                            |
| P2.6 | Add backup/restore runbook.                               | Operator can restore collab Y.Doc snapshot and host file bytes to a previous known-good version.                                                | Todo                                                                                                                                                       |
| P2.7 | Add “last saved / saving / offline / error” status model. | Status is consistent across title bar, file source, collab, and version history.                                                                | Partial — `AutosaveStatus` exposes saving/saved/error with `aria-live`; it is not yet unified with collab connection and version-history status.           |
| P2.8 | Define final-drain snapshot strategy.                     | Either server can produce final file snapshot, or product explicitly guarantees client-push only with UI/ops safeguards. No vague middle state. | Todo                                                                                                                                                       |
| P2.9 | Add data-loss incident tests.                             | Kill browser, collab, gateway, and storage in separate tests; assert exact expected recovery behavior.                                          | Todo                                                                                                                                                       |

**Exit criteria:** We can state exactly when a user edit is durable, prove it, and recover from failure without data loss surprises.

## Phase 3 — Fidelity And Document Safety

**Goal:** Do not damage real user documents.

| ID   | Task                                                | Acceptance gate                                                                                                                     | Status                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| P3.1 | Keep round-trip audit mandatory.                    | CI fails if pristine fixture count drops or any known OOXML preservation bucket regresses.                                          | Covered — `ci.yml` runs `scripts/roundtrip-audit.mjs`; many focused OOXML unit tests exist.                                                                                          |
| P3.2 | Keep visual fidelity CI mandatory.                  | Visual-fidelity floor and page-count mismatch limits are enforced in CI for representative corpus.                                  | Covered — `visual-fidelity.yml` enforces representative corpus floor and uploads reports.                                                                                            |
| P3.3 | Build extreme-corpus tracker.                       | CJK SDS, dense forms, table-heavy docs, image-heavy docs, and legal/medical templates have named scores and owners.                 | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| P3.4 | Fix exact line-height model for dense/CJK docs.     | Target fixtures improve without regressing everyday corpus or round-trip audit.                                                     | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| P3.5 | Fix measured table row geometry.                    | Dense forms do not drift by accumulated row-height error across pages.                                                              | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| P3.6 | Preserve drawings/images through collab save paths. | Multi-peer edit/save/reopen tests verify images, shapes, textboxes, anchors, wraps, and raw XML envelopes survive.                  | Partial — shapes and text boxes carry `rawXml`/`envelopeKey` through PM/Yjs; images have serializer support but the PM image schema/conversion path does not carry those fields yet. |
| P3.7 | Expand imported equation editability.               | Imported Word equation opens with meaningful editable representation or clear replace-only UX.                                      | Partial — equation render/insert/edit tests exist; imported OMML-to-edit-source gap remains.                                                                                         |
| P3.8 | Add document safety warnings.                       | If a feature is unsupported or degraded on import, user gets a non-alarming but clear warning before save/export when risk is real. | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| P3.9 | Add real-world fixture intake process.              | New customer/user docs can be anonymized, scored, classified, and tracked without ad hoc one-off debugging.                         | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                 |

**Exit criteria:** Normal documents are stable, extreme documents are honestly tracked, and unsupported fidelity cases are visible rather than silent.

## Phase 4 — Accessibility, WCAG, IME, And Dark Mode

**Goal:** Accessibility is a product feature, not a patch.

| ID    | Task                                       | Acceptance gate                                                                                                                                   | Status                                                                                                                        |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P4.1  | Define WCAG 2.2 AA target scope.           | Scope separates app chrome/editor workflows from user-authored document content. Exceptions are documented.                                       | Todo                                                                                                                          |
| P4.2  | Add automated contrast audit.              | Light/dark chrome tokens and rendered components fail CI below 4.5:1 for normal text or 3:1 for UI graphics/large text.                           | Todo                                                                                                                          |
| P4.3  | Fix dark-mode weak text tokens.            | Placeholder/helper/metadata text that users must read meets contrast; disabled-only text remains visually disabled but not used for instructions. | Todo                                                                                                                          |
| P4.4  | Add axe checks for core workflows.         | Home, editor, file menu, share dialog, find/replace, comments, version history, properties, image/table panels, equation dialog.                  | Partial — editor a11y contract and accessibility dialog tests exist; axe workflow suite not found.                            |
| P4.5  | Add keyboard-only workflow tests.          | Open, edit, format, find/replace, comment, track changes, version restore, share, table editing, image formatting all work without mouse.         | Partial — broad keyboard/shortcut Playwright coverage exists; needs explicit keyboard-only workflow map.                      |
| P4.6  | Add focus-order and focus-visible tests.   | No invisible focus, no focus trap leaks, no focus hidden behind overlays, no obscured focused control.                                            | Partial — focus recapture/cursor focus tests and global focus CSS exist; full focus-order gate remains.                       |
| P4.7  | Validate screen-reader contract manually.  | NVDA + Firefox/Chrome, JAWS + Chrome, VoiceOver + Safari: editing, navigation, toolbar, dialogs, comments, status messages.                       | Todo                                                                                                                          |
| P4.8  | Fix IME/CJK input architecture.            | Japanese, Chinese, Korean composition candidate window appears in correct viewport location and text commits correctly.                           | Partial — `ime-caret-sync.spec.ts` covers candidate-window positioning mechanism; full IME/CJK manual/browser matrix remains. |
| P4.9  | Add reduced-motion and high-contrast pass. | Animations respect reduced motion; forced-colors/high-contrast mode keeps controls visible and usable.                                            | Todo                                                                                                                          |
| P4.10 | Add target-size audit.                     | Mobile/touch controls meet WCAG 2.2 target-size expectations or documented exceptions; no tiny critical controls.                                 | Todo                                                                                                                          |

**Exit criteria:** We can make a cautious WCAG 2.2 AA claim for app chrome/core workflows with evidence, not vibes.

## Phase 5 — UI/UX Polish And Workflow Quality

**Goal:** The editor should feel calm, clean, predictable, and professional.

| ID    | Task                            | Acceptance gate                                                                                                                          | Status                                                                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P5.1  | Establish design QA checklist.  | Every flow is reviewed for spacing, typography, target size, hover/pressed/focus states, empty/loading/error states, and dark mode.      | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.2  | Normalize component primitives. | Buttons, icon buttons, menus, dialogs, tabs, inputs, tooltips, popovers, and side panels use shared primitives or documented exceptions. | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.3  | Audit all inline styles.        | Inline styles are removed or justified where they block theme, focus, contrast, or consistency.                                          | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.4  | Polish title bar and toolbar.   | Toolbar controls are dense but not cramped; groups are consistent; labels/tooltips/shortcuts are clear; overflow is predictable.         | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.5  | Polish right rail.              | Comments, properties, track changes, version history, AI/writing, and outline do not fight for space; one active surface is obvious.     | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.6  | Polish share/collab UX.         | Share flow clearly distinguishes edit/view links, password/share-token role, copy success, connection state, and permission errors.      | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.7  | Polish recovery UX.             | Offline, reconnecting, saving failed, conflict, restore autosave, and version restore states are understandable and non-destructive.     | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.8  | Polish dark mode.               | No light flashes, low-contrast labels, mismatched surfaces, hardcoded colors, or unreadable icons in dark mode.                          | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.9  | Polish mobile/narrow shell.     | App is usable at narrow widths for review/light editing; unsupported desktop-only actions degrade cleanly.                               | Todo                                                                                                                         |
| P5.10 | Add screenshot review suite.    | Playwright captures canonical light/dark screenshots for main workflows and flags obvious UI regressions.                                | Partial — visual regression screenshots and version-history visual audit exist; canonical light/dark workflow suite remains. |

**Exit criteria:** The product no longer feels like a demo shell around a powerful engine.

## Phase 6 — Security, Auth, Sharing, And Admin

**Goal:** Self-hosted production customers can operate it safely.

| ID   | Task                                | Acceptance gate                                                                                                         | Status                                                                                          |
| ---- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P6.1 | Threat-model share links.           | Documented risks: token leakage, password brute force, view-only bypass, room guessing, replay, expiration, revocation. | Todo                                                                                            |
| P6.2 | Rate-limit sensitive routes.        | Login, share validation, uploads, room creation, password checks, and admin routes have tested limits.                  | Partial — collab rate-limit plumbing exists; route-by-route production verification needed.     |
| P6.3 | Harden upload handling.             | File size, extension, MIME sniffing, zip bombs, corrupt OOXML, malformed XML, and worker failures are handled.          | Partial — upload limits/tests exist in gateway/collab; complete adversarial-file suite remains. |
| P6.4 | Unify JWT/share-token semantics.    | Docs/Sheets/Slides use same claim shape, lateral-access guard, expiry, role mapping, and feature flags.                 | Partial — collab auth/share-token tests are extensive; suite-wide contract remains.             |
| P6.5 | Make admin UI production-safe.      | Secrets redacted, config write validates, audit log records changes, dangerous toggles warn clearly.                    | Partial — admin config/routes/webhook tests exist; audit log/dangerous-toggle UX remains.       |
| P6.6 | Add audit logs.                     | Share created, joined, saved, version restored, file renamed, permission changed, admin config changed.                 | Todo                                                                                            |
| P6.7 | Define CORS/base-path/proxy policy. | Same-origin deploy is default; cross-origin embed is explicit and tested.                                               | Todo                                                                                            |
| P6.8 | Add dependency/license gate.        | No AGPL contamination in editor path; security scan and license report run before release.                              | Todo                                                                                            |

**Exit criteria:** A serious operator can deploy this without accepting hidden security assumptions.

## Phase 7 — Deployment, Operations, And Scale

**Goal:** Installation and operation are boring.

| ID   | Task                                      | Acceptance gate                                                                                                 | Status                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| P7.1 | Official Docker Compose production stack. | Gateway, collab, storage, reverse proxy, volumes, health checks, restart policy, and example env are complete.  | Partial — stack/proxy files exist, but production Y.Doc persistence is misconfigured (`CASUAL_STORAGE=local` does not affect `DocStorage`) and readiness/health checks are insufficient. |
| P7.2 | Kubernetes reference manifest.            | Optional but production-ready: deployments, services, ingress, probes, secrets, persistent volumes.             | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| P7.3 | Backup and restore docs.                  | Host files, collab snapshots, user DB, admin config, and version history backup/restore are covered.            | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| P7.4 | Observability package.                    | Structured logs, request IDs, room IDs, user/session IDs where safe, metrics, and health dashboard.             | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| P7.5 | Load test suite.                          | Concurrent rooms, concurrent users per room, large docs, reconnect storm, autosave storm, upload storm.         | Partial — collab load/wsload scripts exist; production thresholds and CI/nightly use remain.                                                                                             |
| P7.6 | Upgrade/migration playbook.               | Versioned config, DB migrations, Y.Doc snapshot compatibility, rollback plan, blue/green notes.                 | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| P7.7 | Resource sizing guide.                    | CPU/RAM/storage estimates for small, medium, large deployments.                                                 | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| P7.8 | Failure-mode runbook.                     | What to do when collab cannot save, storage is down, proxy WS upgrade breaks, or host returns version conflict. | Todo                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**Exit criteria:** A non-core developer can deploy, monitor, upgrade, and recover the system.

## Phase 8 — Suite Integration

**Goal:** Users experience one office product, not separate experiments.

| ID   | Task                             | Acceptance gate                                                                                                                         | Status |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| P8.1 | Shared file/home shell.          | Open/recent/share/version/auth flows are consistent across Docs, Sheets, and Slides.                                                    | Todo   |
| P8.2 | Shared collab service contract.  | Product-specific clients use the same room creation, role, snapshot, storage, and health APIs.                                          | Todo   |
| P8.3 | Shared admin and storage config. | Operators configure storage/auth/proxy/webhooks once for the suite or with clear per-product overrides.                                 | Todo   |
| P8.4 | Shared desktop bridge contract.  | Ubuntu/macOS/Windows desktop shell opens local files, routes by extension, saves safely, and disables unsupported collab flows offline. | Todo   |
| P8.5 | Cross-product visual identity.   | Docs, Sheets, Slides feel related but not identical; each product has appropriate density and controls.                                 | Todo   |
| P8.6 | Cross-product release gate.      | A suite release cannot ship if one product breaks auth, sharing, storage, or collab contract.                                           | Todo   |

**Exit criteria:** A user can install one product suite and use documents/spreadsheets/presentations with consistent behavior.

## Phase 9 — Competitive Feature Closure

**Goal:** Close the gaps users expect from LibreOffice and OnlyOffice alternatives.

| ID   | Task                      | Acceptance gate                                                                                                     | Status |
| ---- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| P9.1 | Document comparison.      | Compare two `.docx` files and produce readable insert/delete changes.                                               | Todo   |
| P9.2 | Mail merge.               | Data source + field insertion + preview + export; interoperable with Word where possible.                           | Todo   |
| P9.3 | Forms/content controls.   | SDT controls render, edit, validate, and round-trip.                                                                | Todo   |
| P9.4 | Broader style management. | Create/modify paragraph and character styles without breaking OOXML inheritance.                                    | Todo   |
| P9.5 | Navigator/outline parity. | Large-doc navigation covers headings, tables, images, comments, changes, footnotes/endnotes.                        | Todo   |
| P9.6 | Advanced WOPI polish.     | Lock/refresh/unlock, version, rename, permissions, and host error UX match enterprise expectations.                 | Todo   |
| P9.7 | Offline-first desktop.    | Local files, crash recovery, file associations, recent files, and auto-update are reliable on Ubuntu/macOS/Windows. | Todo   |

**Exit criteria:** The product can be honestly compared with LibreOffice/OnlyOffice for serious document work, with documented remaining gaps.

---

## Phase 10 — CI, Playwright, And Blast-Radius Discipline

**Goal:** CI is a product safety system. It must be fast enough to run often, broad enough to catch regressions, and stable enough that failures are trusted.

| ID     | Task                                             | Acceptance gate                                                                                                                                                                       | Status                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| P10.1  | Create a test ownership map.                     | Every suite has an owner area: fidelity, editor input, collab, file source, UX chrome, accessibility, deployment, backend, storage.                                                   | Todo                                                                                                                                 |
| P10.2  | Define test tiers.                               | `PR quick`, `PR full`, `nightly stress`, and `release candidate` are documented with exact commands and pass criteria.                                                                | Partial — CI has lint/unit/build/roundtrip/sharded e2e/backend plus separate visual/fidelity workflows; formal tier policy remains.  |
| P10.3  | Make Playwright workflow coverage explicit.      | Each core user workflow maps to at least one Playwright test: open, edit, save, collab, share, comment, track changes, version restore, table, image, equation, find/replace, export. | Partial — broad workflow coverage exists; needs an explicit coverage map rather than discovery by filename.                          |
| P10.4  | Add blast-radius labels to tests.                | Failing test names or metadata identify the impacted surface: `fidelity`, `collab`, `a11y`, `dark-mode`, `save`, `storage`, `ux`, `security`, `deploy`.                               | Partial — many filenames are descriptive; no formal metadata/label taxonomy found.                                                   |
| P10.5  | Eliminate silent flaky tests.                    | Flakes are quarantined only with an issue and owner; release candidate cannot pass with quarantined production-critical workflows.                                                    | Todo                                                                                                                                 |
| P10.6  | Add CI artifact discipline.                      | Playwright traces, screenshots, videos, visual diffs, fidelity reports, and logs are uploaded consistently and linked from failed jobs.                                               | Partial — Playwright HTML/screenshots and visual/fidelity reports upload; broader logs/traces/deploy artifacts need standardization. |
| P10.7  | Add deterministic seed data.                     | Fixtures, users, share tokens, room IDs, timestamps, and random colors are controlled enough to avoid snapshot noise.                                                                 | Todo                                                                                                                                 |
| P10.8  | Add cross-browser minimum.                       | Chromium remains primary; Firefox/WebKit smoke cover accessibility, editing, save, and layout assumptions before production release.                                                  | Todo                                                                                                                                 |
| P10.9  | Add dark-mode and accessibility Playwright pass. | Same workflow tests run in light and dark where relevant; axe/focus/keyboard failures block release.                                                                                  | Partial — a11y/IME/focus tests exist; dark-mode and axe matrix remains.                                                              |
| P10.10 | Add collab CI service topology.                  | CI starts real gateway + real collab + persistent test storage + proxy, not mocked peers only.                                                                                        | Todo                                                                                                                                 |
| P10.11 | Add deploy smoke test.                           | Built production compose stack is started, health/readiness checked, two-peer edit/save/reload verified, then cleanly torn down.                                                      | Todo                                                                                                                                 |
| P10.12 | Add performance budgets.                         | Large-doc open, type, save, collab sync, and version preview have thresholds with trend artifacts.                                                                                    | Partial — large-doc performance Playwright exists; trend/artifact/budget policy remains.                                             |
| P10.13 | Add failure triage protocol.                     | Red CI is categorized as product regression, test bug, infra bug, or known flaky; every category has a required follow-up.                                                            | Todo                                                                                                                                 |
| P10.14 | Add release-candidate CI gate.                   | A release candidate runs full matrix: unit, typecheck, lint, roundtrip, visual fidelity, Playwright, accessibility, collab, backend, deploy smoke.                                    | Todo                                                                                                                                 |

**Exit criteria:** When CI is red, the team can quickly tell what broke, where the blast radius is, and whether the product is safe to ship.

## Strict Definition Of Done

Every production task must satisfy all applicable items:

1. User-facing behavior implemented.
2. Error, empty, loading, offline, and permission-denied states implemented.
3. Light and dark themes reviewed.
4. Keyboard path works.
5. Screen-reader semantics are present for interactive controls.
6. Tests added at the lowest useful level and at least one user-flow level for risky behavior.
7. Failure mode is documented.
8. Deployment/ops implications are documented.
9. No regression in round-trip audit, visual-fidelity gate, typecheck, unit tests, and e2e smoke.
10. The test added for the change is correctly placed in the test pyramid; broad Playwright coverage is used for user workflows, not as a substitute for focused unit/integration coverage.
11. CI failure output is actionable: test name, artifact, trace/log, and affected surface are clear.
12. Product copy is honest: no “production”, “WCAG”, “lossless”, “self-hosted”, or “compatible” claim without evidence.

---

## Immediate Next Sprint

The next sprint should not add new flashy features. It should remove production ambiguity.

1. Update README, Dockerfile comments, and architecture docs to make Node/Hocuspocus collab the canonical backend.
2. Fix production collab persistence: either require `REDIS_URL` in prod compose/docs or implement a real local/s3/postgres `DocStorage` path for Y.Doc updates.
3. Add production readiness failure for in-memory collab storage and a storage write/read/delete probe.
4. Fix Hocuspocus shutdown drain so queued debounced saves are persisted before process exit.
5. Add same-origin `/yjs` two-peer smoke test.
6. Add image `rawXml`/`envelopeKey` carriage through the PM/Yjs image node path, then test save/reopen through collab.
7. Add dark-mode contrast audit script for design tokens and rendered core chrome.
8. Add axe checks for editor, share dialog, comments, version history, and properties dialog.
9. Add crash/reconnect autosave test for Docs against the real collab server.
10. Create CI/test ownership map and label existing Playwright suites by blast radius.
11. Create release checklist template and require it for any “production” release candidate.

## Implementation Evidence Counted In This Tracker

This section exists to prevent duplicate work and to keep the tracker honest. The status calls above are based on implementation paths, not only workflow names.

- **Collab server boot path:** `collab/src/index.ts` creates `DocStorage` first, logs Redis vs in-memory storage, then creates separate workbook file hosting via `createHost()`. This proves collab Y.Doc storage and workbook file storage are different systems.
- **Y.Doc persistence:** `collab/src/storage.ts` implements only `InMemoryStorage` and `RedisStorage`; `createStorage()` ignores `CASUAL_STORAGE` and selects Redis only when `REDIS_URL` exists.
- **Production deploy mismatch:** `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml` sets `CASUAL_STORAGE=local` and `CASUAL_LOCAL_PATH=/data` under a comment that says it persists Y.Doc snapshots, but those env vars are consumed by `collab/src/host/index.ts`, not by `DocStorage`.
- **Hocuspocus lifecycle:** `collab/src/yjs.ts` loads seed + persisted updates, enforces share-token/view-only roles server-side, queues debounced saves on change, and currently clears pending timers on close without flushing the underlying Y.Doc update.
- **Docs collab wiring:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/collab/useCollab.ts` wires HocuspocusProvider, `ySyncPlugin`, cursors, strict co-editing, `yUndoPlugin`, and Y.Maps for metadata, comments, footnotes, endnotes, and document properties.
- **Docs collab host:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/components/CasualEditor.tsx` passes collab plugins as external content and bridges comments/footnotes/endnotes/properties through the Y.Maps.
- **Save pipeline:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/components/DocxEditor.tsx` serializes current PM state through `DocumentAgent.toBuffer`; `docx-editor/packages/core/src/agent/DocumentAgent.ts` attempts selective save when possible and falls back to full repack.
- **Autosave:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/file-source/useFileSourceAutoSave.ts` has interval save, `visibilitychange`/`pagehide` flush, status/error tracking, and focused unit tests; `AutosaveStatus.tsx` exposes an `aria-live` status indicator.
- **Drawing fidelity through PM/Yjs:** shape and text box extensions/conversions carry `rawXml`/`envelopeKey`; image conversion currently does not carry these attributes even though the serializer can emit `Image.rawXml`.
- **Accessibility baseline:** `docx-editor/packages/react/src/paged-editor/HiddenProseMirror.tsx` keeps the real contenteditable screen-reader accessible with `role="textbox"`, `aria-multiline`, and an accessible name while visual pages stay separate.
- **Dark theme implementation:** `DocxEditor.tsx` applies `data-theme` from persisted light/dark/auto mode and `TitleBar.tsx` exposes the theme toggle; the missing gate is measured WCAG contrast across rendered chrome, not absence of a theme switch.
- **Main CI:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs format, lint, typecheck, unit tests, build, round-trip audit, sharded Chromium Playwright, and Go vet/race/build.
- **Visual fidelity:** `.github/workflows/visual-fidelity.yml` renders representative `.docx` fixtures against LibreOffice references and enforces the configured floor.
- **Fidelity comparison:** `.github/workflows/fidelity-compare.yml` compares against LibreOffice and OnlyOffice DocumentBuilder on demand/main-path changes and uploads reports.
- **Deployment topology:** `deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`, `deploy/Caddyfile`, and `deploy/README.md` define the two-service gateway + collab + same-origin `/yjs` shape, but the current storage env/docs must be corrected before calling it production-complete.
- **Collab unit coverage:** `collab/src/**.unit.test.ts` covers room caps/eviction, personal files, share links, ACLs, auth/JWT, join-role resolution, WOPI routes, host backends, admin config, and webhooks.
- **Docs collab transport coverage:** `packages/react/src/collab/*Sync.test.ts` and `strictCoEditing.test.ts` cover props, comments, footnotes, and strict co-editing behavior at unit level.
- **Accessibility/focus/IME coverage:** `editor-a11y.spec.ts`, `accessibility-dialog.spec.ts`, `editor-focus-recapture.spec.ts`, `cursor-focus.spec.ts`, and `ime-caret-sync.spec.ts` cover important baseline contracts, but not a full WCAG/AT matrix.
- **Feature workflow coverage:** Playwright specs exist for version history/preview, track changes, equations, comments, tables, images, find/replace, formatting, markdown, auth gate, export PDF, mobile behavior, and many document-fidelity regressions.
- **Performance coverage:** `performance-large-docs.spec.ts` exists, but production budgets/trend reporting still need to be formalized.

### Behavioral analysis — verified false-positives (do not re-chase)

A 2026-06-27 multi-agent bug hunt produced ~18 candidates; most did not survive verification against the actual code. Recorded so future sessions don't redo the work:

- **ParaIdAllocator "stale positions" (claimed P0)** — false: `setNodeMarkup` preserves node size, so forward iteration keeps positions valid.
- **ListExtension `tr.split` "invalid API"** — false: ProseMirror's `tr.split(pos, depth, typesAfter)` accepts `{type, attrs}` objects.
- **Orphaned reply comments "remove the `parentId == null` guard"** — false AND harmful: replies carry no independent document mark, so the change would delete every reply. Current code is correct.
- **suggestionMode insert-at-`to` ordering** — not a bug: insertion-after-deletion is a valid track-changes convention; changing it needs a Word/GDocs spec + visual verification.
- **`htmlToRuns` "drops trailing break"** — not a bug: omitting the trailing break is correct inline-paste behavior (a forced break would add a stray empty paragraph).
- **`goToNextCell`/`goToPrevCell` "hardcoded offsets break multi-paragraph cells"** — false: Tab moves to the next _cell_ (first paragraph via `Selection.near`); the offsets walk structural nesting, not a single-paragraph assumption.
- **`calculateHeaderFooterVisualBounds` `visualTop = 0` "should be Infinity"** — false AND harmful: `cursorY` starts at 0 so the first block yields `visualTop = 0`; the inits (`0` / `flowHeight`) are deliberate so an empty block list can't produce a negative-height box. The `Infinity`/`-Infinity` "fix" breaks that.
- **Footnote serializer "regex id not escaped"** — non-issue: `note.id` is numeric, so no regex metacharacters are possible.
- **core.xml "fields inserted in reverse order"** — non-issue: OOXML element order is not significant for core properties.

### Behavioral analysis — candidates needing verification (not yet actioned)

Plausible but require visual verification or are feature gaps, not clean safe fixes — left here so they're not lost:

- **Print `@page { size: auto }`** (P2, export) — exported/printed PDF pages may follow the print dialog's paper size rather than the document's page size (`DocxEditor.tsx` print path). Setting `@page size` from the doc's page dimensions would improve WYSIWYG, but needs real PDF-output verification and care for mixed page sizes (landscape sections). Do NOT change blind.
- **Even/odd headers (`evenAndOddHeaders`)** (feature gap, not a regression) — `layout-engine/index.ts` accepts the flag but `void`s it; even-page headers/footers are not rendered. This is an unimplemented feature, scoped separately.
- **Footnote definition orphaned on reference delete** (P2) — deleting a footnote reference may leave its definition in `footnotes.xml`; needs care around the footnote data model + collab `footnoteSync` before fixing.
- **PAGE/NUMPAGES field `displayText` stale on export** (P2) — serialized field result can carry the load-time page number; Word recomputes on field update, so cosmetic until then. Post-pagination attr sync is the fix, non-trivial.

## Multi-surface audit — 2026-07-04

A whole-product audit pass (desktop / collab / SDK / editor / webapp demo), each
finding verified against source. Fixes shipped this pass are marked; outstanding
items are ranked for follow-up. Verification threw out several plausible-but-false
claims (e.g. `buildTableGrid` "wrong position formula" — the offsets are byte
offsets, not indices, so the formula is correct; `goToNextCell` merged-last-row
"malformed clone" — per-cell iteration preserves colspan).

| md-chrome-mismatch        | P2       | Markdown editor   | txt/md editor didn't follow the docs editor's design language      | **Fixed** — `--md-*` mapped onto the docs `--doc-*` chrome tokens + Inter font (`f078498`)                    |

### Editor / SDK (docx-editor)

| ID                        | Severity | Status                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| table-deletecolumn-colspan | P0      | **Fixed** — `deleteColumn` reduces a spanning cell's colspan instead of deleting it (`127abc4`)             |
| imprint-textshadow-missing | P0      | **Fixed** — `ImprintExtension.toDOM` was missing the `text-shadow:` prefix (`45d8bc0`)                      |
| hf-view-destroy-on-scroll | P0       | **Fixed** — HF PM view was rebuilt from original content on every scroll; keyed to container availability   |
| ismarkactive-any-vs-all   | P1       | **Fixed** — toolbar mark state now requires ALL selected text to carry the mark, not any (`497670b`)        |
| image-paste-loses-anchor  | P1       | **Fixed** — image toDOM/parseDOM round-trip position/wrap/crop/opacity/link (`497670b`)                     |
| sdk-cjs-worker-esm-url     | P1      | **Fixed** — tsup worker-URL rewrite is now format-aware (`.js` cjs / `.mjs` esm); root cause of GH #4 (`74fccbb`) |
| sdk-core-version-skew      | P1      | **Fixed** — `@schnsrw/core` range bumped `^0.1.1`→`^0.2.0` to match npm (`74fccbb`)                          |
| sdk-stale-version-docs     | P2      | **Fixed** — `VERSION` const + CSS-import example corrected (`74fccbb`)                                       |
| sdk-styles-root-leak       | P0      | **Todo** — `dist/styles.css` emits 3 unscoped `:root` token blocks that override the host app; emit under `.ep-root`/`[data-app=docs]` |
| find-not-in-headers        | P1      | **Todo** — `handleFind`/`handleReplace` use the body view; should use `getActiveEditorView()` so Cmd+F searches an open header/footer |
| comment-anchorpos-zero     | P2      | **Todo** — comment cards fall back to `anchorPos: 0` (doc top) before the layout pipeline resolves anchors  |
| versiondiff-token-cap      | P2      | **Todo** — diffs over 6k tokens/side silently return a clean doc; surface a "diff too large" notice          |

### Collab server (Node/Hocuspocus) — PR CasualOffice/collab#4

| ID                        | Severity | Status                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| collab-sigterm-drops-saves | P0      | **Fixed (PR #4)** — `close()` drains pending debounced saves instead of cancelling them                     |
| collab-no-drain-snapshot   | P0      | **Fixed (PR #4)** — flush the room's pending save when the last client disconnects                          |
| collab-ephemeral-prod      | P0      | **Fixed (PR #4)** — refuse to boot on `NODE_ENV=production` + in-memory storage unless `ALLOW_EPHEMERAL`     |
| collab-prod-compose-memory | P0      | **Todo** — `docker-compose.prod.yml` comments promise Y.Doc persistence but `REDIS_URL` is commented out    |
| collab-trustproxy-off      | P1      | **Todo** — Fastify has no `trustProxy`; rate-limit keys on the proxy IP behind Caddy, collapsing all clients |
| collab-room-id-math-random | P1      | **Todo** — `makeRoomId()` uses `Math.random()`; open rooms are readable by id — use `crypto.randomBytes`     |
| collab-rooms-list-unauth   | P1      | **Todo** — `GET /api/rooms` returns every live room id unauthenticated (enables enumeration)                 |
| collab-upload-no-validation | P2     | **Todo** — `/seed` and file upload accept any bytes (only a size cap); no zip/OOXML magic-byte check         |
| collab-cors-open            | P2      | **Todo** — `origin: true` reflects any Origin; restrict in production                                        |
| collab-docker-root-nolock   | P2      | **Todo** — Dockerfile runs as root, no lockfile (`npm install`), ships source + `tsx`; add `USER node`+`npm ci` |
| collab-no-healthcheck       | P2      | **Todo** — no `HEALTHCHECK`/compose readiness gate; Caddy can route before the app is ready                 |

### Desktop (Tauri / Rust)

| ID                        | Severity | Status                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| desk-model-no-integrity   | P0       | **Todo** — downloaded AI models have no SHA-256/size verification before load; add a `sha256` catalog field |
| desk-worker-mutex-poison  | P1       | **Todo** — `worker.lock().unwrap()` (4 spots in `ai_local.rs`) poisons on panic; use `unwrap_or_else(into_inner)` |
| desk-iframe-save-nonatomic | P1      | **Todo** — the iframe `save` path is a non-atomic `fs::write` with no empty-byte guard (data-loss on crash) |
| desk-readchunk-unbounded  | P1       | **Todo** — `read_document_chunk` allocates a caller-supplied `length` up-front; clamp to a max + remaining  |
| desk-llm-lock-whole-infer | P1       | **Todo** — `run_local_infer` holds the worker lock across the whole token loop; AI surface freezes mid-gen  |
| desk-no-kv-cache-reuse    | P1       | **Todo** — a fresh llama context per request re-prefills the whole prompt (CPU latency)                     |
| desk-download-no-resume   | P1       | **Todo** — concurrent downloads share one `.part` file; no range/resume                                    |
