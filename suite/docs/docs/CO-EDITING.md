   Node collab server
   (Hocuspocus + Yjs, CasualOffice/collab)
   per-docId room
```

- Each open document maps to a single `Y.Doc` shared by all peers in the room.
- `y-prosemirror`'s `ySyncPlugin` keeps the Y.Doc and ProseMirror state coherent in both directions — local edits become Y.Doc updates; remote Y.Doc updates become PM transactions.
- Updates travel over the [y-websocket protocol](https://github.com/yjs/y-websocket) — a binary message format the collab server merges into its authoritative Y.Doc and re-broadcasts.

The collab server holds one authoritative `Y.Doc` per room. It applies each incoming update to that server-side doc, re-broadcasts the merged result to the other peers, and syncs a freshly-joined peer from the server's current state (not from a replay of raw frames).

---

## Awareness (presence)

Yjs ships with an `Awareness` channel that's separate from the document CRDT. Casual Editor uses it for:

- **Live cursors** — each peer's selection range, with a color and name label.
- **Live-typing ghost** — characters appear in peers' views as you type, before the change commits to Y.Doc.
- **Presence avatars** — title-bar stack with "Active now / Last seen Ns ago".

Awareness state is ephemeral. Peers re-broadcast on tab focus and reconnect, so dropped clients clean up automatically after a timeout.

---

## Rooms

A room is keyed by `docId`. The collab server creates the room lazily on the first peer's WS connection and tears it down when the last peer disconnects.

```
Lifecycle:
  first peer connects       → room created, host.GetFile() seeds initial bytes
  every peer connection     → joins existing Y.Doc, snapshot-sync'd by Yjs
  last peer disconnects     → host.PutFile() flushes final snapshot, room dropped
  process restart           → all rooms gone; next peer reconnect re-seeds via GetFile
```

This means **the collab server never stores documents.** Persistence is the host's job (`inline`, `wopi`, or `jwtapi`).

---

## Password protection

Rooms can be created with a password. The collab server gates the WS upgrade:

- Client sends password as `?p=<pw>` on the WS URL.
- The server SHA-256s it, constant-time compares against the room's stored hash, closes with code `4401` on mismatch.

This is sufficient for casual share-link workflows. For stronger auth, integrate via the `jwtapi` host (signed tokens with claim-based permissions).

---

## View-only enforcement

View-only joiners cannot mutate the document. Enforcement happens at the Y.Doc transaction layer in the editor (rejecting outgoing updates) **and** at the collab server (refusing to apply updates from view-only sessions).

This belt-and-suspenders design means a malicious client editing the bundle still can't write to the shared Y.Doc, because the collab server marks such connections read-only per each peer's permission level and never applies their updates to the authoritative doc.

---

## The collab server: Hocuspocus (Node)

Real-time sync, presence, auth, and snapshots are served by the shared **Node/TypeScript**
collab server **`CasualOffice/collab`** — [Hocuspocus](https://tiptap.dev/hocuspocus) + Yjs on
Fastify, a format-agnostic server shared with Casual Sheets. The editor connects to it with
`HocuspocusProvider` (`docx-editor/packages/react/src/collab/useCollab.ts`), still speaking the
y-websocket protocol on the wire.

Hocuspocus gives us a maintained extension model (auth hooks, WOPI, pluggable storage,
snapshots/versioning) and one server reused across products. (An earlier in-repo **Go**
y-websocket gateway under `backend/` predates this and is superseded — historical only.)
