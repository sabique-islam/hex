/**
 * Regression for the "text runs off the page" bug.
 *
 * The renderer only applies POSITIVE left/right indents (renderParagraph clamps
 * negatives to 0). Measurement, however, used the signed indent, so a negative
 * left/right indent WIDENED the wrap width (maxWidth - (-n) = maxWidth + n).
 * Lines were then packed wider than the content box and painted (white-space:
 * pre) past the page margin. Measurement must clamp block indent to >= 0 to
 * match the renderer, so a negative indent wraps exactly like a zero indent.
