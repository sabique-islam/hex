/**
 * Proving test for the co-editing fidelity gap (audit doc 17, §2).
 *
 * The raw-XML envelopes that preserve VML / DrawingML / textbox drawings on
 * round-trip live on the parsed Document model (`Shape.rawXml`), NOT in the
 * ProseMirror document. Everything that travels over the Yjs CRDT in a collab
 * session IS the ProseMirror document. So anything reconstructing a Document
 * *from* the Y.Doc — e.g. a server-side snapshot decoding the shared state, or
 * a peer that joined without the original seed — rebuilds the body from PM and
 * silently drops those envelopes.
 *
 * This test pins that loss, and the crucial corollary: holding the seed and
 * passing it to `fromProseDoc` does NOT save inline body drawings, because
 * `fromProseDoc` rebuilds `document.content` from PM blocks (`extractBlocks`);
 * the seed only restores section-level scaffolding (headers/footers/sections).
 *
 * Therefore the server-side-snapshot fix (chosen direction) must apply a
 * SELECTIVE SAVE against the seed BYTES — keeping untouched drawings' original
 * XML verbatim — not a from-PM re-serialize. When that fix lands, the
 * `not.toContain` assertions below flip to `toContain` for the seed path, and
 * this file becomes its regression guard.
