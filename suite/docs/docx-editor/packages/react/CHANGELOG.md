## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 886a649: Fix `chrome:"embedded"` hiding the editing menus. The embedded resolver welded the menu-bar default to the app-shell default, so embedded stripped the whole menu bar — stranding the ~50 features that live only there (Insert image/table, Format paragraph, Tools word-count, …). Embedded now keeps the formatting toolbar AND the editing menus, dropping only the app shell: the logo/document-name row and the host-owned File/Help entries (Open/New/Version-history/About). Hosts can still force either region with `features={{ menuBar, titleBar }}`.

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- c188dd9: Fix click-time canvas flicker and Linux out-of-memory caused by font loading. Each font `loadingdone` event previously triggered a synchronous, cache-clearing full relayout; a document pulling in many `@font-face` subsets plus the icon font produced a burst of full re-measures (visible as flicker on click, and an OOM on Linux). Font-load relayouts are now coalesced through the existing rAF scheduler with a trailing debounce and gated to the families the document actually uses. Also size the text caret to the run's font metrics (~1.2× font-size, centered) instead of the full line-box height, so the caret is no longer 1.5–2× too tall at increased line spacing.

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 4144995: Add `chrome="embedded"` — a formatting-toolbar-only surface for hosts that render their own app shell. It keeps the editing UI (formatting toolbar, panel rail, zoom, ruler) but hides the app shell: logo, document-name row, menu bar, and the About / Help / File menus that live inside them. Cmd/Ctrl+O and Cmd/Ctrl+N are suppressed (the host owns open/new); Cmd/Ctrl+S still routes to `onSave` when provided. The shell rows can also be toggled independently of the toolbar via the new `features.titleBar` / `features.menuBar` ids.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- de0c480: CasualEditor now threads `collab.token` through to the Hocuspocus handshake (previously reserved/unwired). Hosts with a JWT-protected collab server — e.g. Drive minting a per-file room token — can pass `collab={{ server, room, user, token }}` and the token reaches the provider's onAuthenticate hook.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- eefe349: Add an `ai` prop to enable the built-in DocOps assistant. `ai={{ enabled: true }}` unlocks the assistant panel without the `window.__casualFeatures__.docops` global (kept as a deprecated fallback for one minor). `ai.transport` routes model calls and `ai.onAction` fires after each document write the assistant performs. Also forwarded from `CasualEditor`.
- 3bd8602: CollabTransport is now single-round (drivesLoop=false): the collab server is a key-holding LLM proxy for one turn and the panel/agent drives the tool loop — so the plan→execute→reflect agent (and the flat chat loop) run on the web, not only on desktop. Previously the server drove the whole loop, which hid the Agent toggle on every web session.
- 0133f1c: Add a `cspNonce` prop to `CasualEditorIframe` for strict-CSP hosts. When set, the nonce is threaded through the iframe URL and stamped as the `nonce` attribute on every `<style>` / `<link rel="stylesheet">` in the same-origin iframe document (present at load and injected later), so hosts serving `style-src 'nonce-…'` don't have the editor's styles blocked. Also documents the iframe variant as the guaranteed style-isolation path and adds a stable public `--ce-*` CSS custom-property surface aliased over the internal `--doc-*` tokens.
- 1900045: CasualEditor now shows a default reconnecting/offline banner above the editor while a collab session is degraded. Driven by the live collab status, it renders an amber "Reconnecting…" strip when connecting and a red "You're offline — edits saved locally" strip when disconnected, and nothing once connected. Theme-token styled via `--doc-*` vars. Also exported as the standalone `ReconnectBanner` component for hosts that compose their own layout.
- 332de33: Add a `documentMode` prop (`'editing' | 'suggesting' | 'viewing'`) to DocxEditor and CasualEditor, using SuperDoc vocabulary so the docs and sheets SDKs match. It maps onto the existing mode mechanism and takes precedence over the legacy `mode`/`readOnly` props when both are supplied. Also adds runtime `setDocumentMode(mode)` / `getDocumentMode()` methods on the editor ref.
- 0504d96: Add an `onFileOpened` callback to `DocxEditor`, fired after the user opens a file in-window via File → Open. Hosts can react to the document being replaced — the Casual Office desktop shell uses it to unbind the previous file path so a later Save can't overwrite the old file with the newly-opened content.
- 24bd27c: Add an `onRequestOpen` prop to `DocxEditor`. When provided, File → Open (and Ctrl/Cmd-O) calls it instead of opening the browser file picker, letting a host run its own open flow (e.g. a native dialog + "this window or a new window?" prompt). Falls back to the in-window browser picker when absent.
- f4ca55a: Add Insert → Equation: type LaTeX with a live MathML preview (and a quick-insert palette), inline or display, and insert it as a real equation that renders as native math and round-trips into the .docx as native OMML. Also bound to Alt+= (Word/OnlyOffice convention). Rendering uses KaTeX (MIT).
- b280bd0: Render equations in opened .docx files as real math (native MathML) instead of italic plain-text fallback. The stored OMML (`<m:oMath>`/`<m:oMathPara>`) is converted to MathML at layout time and painted as a native `<math>` element. Render-only: the equation's measured text and preserved OMML are unchanged, so round-trip is unaffected. Authoring (Insert → Equation) lands in a follow-up.
- d2af6eb: Add an `onExportPdf` hook to `DocxEditor`. When set and it resolves true, the host handled "Export as PDF" (the Casual Office desktop shell uses its native webview print-to-PDF for selectable-text output reliable on WebKitGTK) and the browser print-dialog fallback is skipped. Unset / false falls back to the existing print pipeline.
- 4d007c6: Add grammar checking (Tools → Grammar check). A pluggable `GrammarExtension` paints a blue squiggle under likely mistakes; right-clicking shows the reason plus a one-click fix. The default engine is an offline, dependency-free rule set (a/an, repeated words, lowercase "i", "could of" → "could have", space before punctuation) tuned for precision; the provider interface (`setGrammarChecker`) lets a server- or LLM-backed pass replace it without UI changes.
- 28f16a8: CasualEditor now mounts the PresenceCluster (peer avatars + Live/Connecting/Offline badge) in the editor title bar whenever collab is active, fed by the live peers and connection status. Standalone (single-user) docs are unaffected. A new optional `onShare` prop wires the cluster's Share button.
- 247e8e1: Mode 3 (Personal/Standalone) now talks to the collab server's auth + files contract instead of the legacy Go gateway. `PersonalFileSource`, `AuthClient`, and the personal-auth UI cut over to collab's shapes: wrapped envelopes (`{ user }` / `{ files }` / `{ file }` / `{ profile }`), the `{ error }` error envelope, `id`/`name`/`etag`/`modifiedAt` file fields, multipart `POST /files` create, `POST /files/:id` replace with `If-Match`, and `PATCH /auth/profile`. Authentication is now by **username** (collab has no email login); the profile dialog's language preference moves into `preferences.locale`. `AuthCredentials` is now `{ username, password }` and `PersonalFileSourceOptions.user` is `{ id, username }`.
- 76cec1e: Add local-first RAG: a BM25 retrieval layer and a `search_document` tool that returns the passages most relevant to a query (with their blockIds). `get_doc_stats` no longer dumps the full document text, which previously overflowed the local model's context on long documents and silently truncated summaries.
- abf824a: Reconcile the SDK surface with the unified contract (doc 38). `CasualEditor` gains a declarative `collab` object — `collab={{ server, room, user }}` — matching the shape Casual Sheets ships; it drives the collab session (`server` is the WS URL, `room` the room id, `user` the presence identity) and wins over the now-`@deprecated` `backendUrl`/`user` pair when both are given. `collab.password`/`token`/`role` are accepted for cross-SDK parity but reserved (not yet wired). The `renderAsync` imperative handle now also exposes the unified surface — `on`/`off`, `executeCommand`, `getContent`/`setContent`, `undo`/`redo`, and `setDocumentMode` — delegating to the underlying editor so the vanilla mount matches the React ref. All additive; existing methods and props are unchanged.
- ddacd85: Add `features` and `editorExtensions` props to `DocxEditor` (and `CasualEditor`). `features` is a per-control on/off map (`Record<string, boolean>`) that hides toolbar controls by id — the coarse `show*` booleans (`showToolbar`, `showStatusBar`, `showPanelRail`, `showZoomControl`, `showPrintButton`, `showOutline`, `showRuler`) now work as deprecated shortcuts, with `features` winning when both are set. `editorExtensions` is a SuperDoc-style API for adding or replacing ProseMirror behavior without forking, layered on top of the existing `externalPlugins`. Exports the `DOCX_FEATURE_IDS` catalog, `FeatureMap`, `isFeatureEnabled`, `EditorExtension`, and `resolveEditorExtensionPlugins`.
- 2897ff1: Add the search_workspace tool + DocsBridge.setWorkspaceDocs() API: the host (desktop shell) can push plain text from the user's local folder into the bridge, and the AI can then retrieve and cite passages across ALL those files — on-device, no cloud. Gracefully unavailable until a workspace is provided.
- 5e30f25: Add a built-in ShareDialog to CasualEditor's collab presence cluster: the title-bar Share button now opens a dialog with a room link, a view/comment/edit role selector, and a copy button. Shown only when collab is active; a host-supplied `onShare` still overrides it. Exported `ShareDialog` and `buildShareUrl` for hosts that want to render it themselves.
- f25974c: Add a Google-Docs-style smart-chip "@" menu in the body: typing `@` opens a caret-anchored menu, and choosing "Date" inserts a DATE field. Also fixes a measure-cache collision where a field inserted as a paragraph's trailing run (e.g. Insert > Date) stayed invisible until the next keystroke.
- b786ead: Add opt-in Strict / paragraph-lock co-editing (OnlyOffice "Strict" pattern). In a collaborative session, enabling Strict co-editing (View menu) locks any paragraph a peer is editing: it shows a dashed outline + faint tint in the peer's colour with their name, and the local user cannot edit it until the peer moves on. It is a local policy derived from peers' existing cursor awareness — only local edits are gated; remote sync is never blocked. Exposed via `setStrictCoEditing` / `isStrictCoEditingEnabled` for hosts wiring their own toggle.
- 732a1e1: Add the unified SDK contract surface to the DocxEditor imperative handle (doc 38). New canonical methods: `getContent()` / `setContent()` / `getSelection()` (aliasing the existing `getDocument` / `loadDocument` / `getSelectionInfo`), `import()` / `export()`, `executeCommand(id, params?)` routed through the editor command registry, `undo()` / `redo()`, and a unified `on(event, handler)` / `off(event, handler)` emitter covering `ready`, `change`, `selectionChange`, `save`, `error`, `dirtyChange`, `documentModeChange`, `collaborationReady`, and `collaborationStatus`. Adds `onDirtyChange` and `onDocumentModeChange` config-callback props (the latter renaming `onModeChange`). Every prior name stays as a deprecated alias, so existing code keeps working. CasualEditor forwards the new props.
- c1ced19: Rework version history to match Google Docs. The panel is now a single auto-saved timeline (the separate "Activity" / recent-edits tab is gone), and a version is also captured on every explicit save (Ctrl+S / File → Save) in addition to the idle interval. Each entry shows who captured it; auto snapshots read as "Auto-saved" with the time alongside. The in-canvas preview gains up/down controls to step between changes, and the panel states up front that versions save automatically (so the optional "Save version…" reads as name-only).
- 95afe3c: Version history: clicking a saved version now opens a full-canvas, read-only preview of that version with the changes since the previous version overlaid inline (insertions underlined per author, deletions struck through), plus a "Show changes" toggle and a "Restore this version" action. Replaces the cramped monospace diff box in the side rail. The Versions rail is also restructured to match Google Docs: a pinned "Current version" row, per-row kebab (⋮) menu consolidating Restore / Rename / Delete, and an "Only named versions" filter.
- 0e7ffaa: WopiFileSource now talks directly to the collab server's WOPI host endpoints (`/wopi/files/:id` CheckFileInfo, `/wopi/files/:id/contents` GetFile/PutFile) instead of the legacy Go gateway's `/api/docs/{id}/download`. `save()` is now implemented as a WOPI PutFile (client-push, with `X-WOPI-ItemVersion` optimistic-write guard) rather than throwing; a host-side version conflict surfaces as the new exported `WopiSaveConflictError`.
- 0b5853c: Add the casual.command.set.workspace embed command + host API (EmbedHostTransport.sendSetWorkspace) so a host can push plain text from the user's local folder into a shared on-device workspace index; the AI's search_workspace tool then retrieves and cites across those files. Nothing leaves the machine.
- b6c6ce3: DocOps AI panel: on the desktop app, a "Folder" button indexes a local folder for on-device workspace RAG (picks a folder, extracts text via the native shell, populates the workspace index the AI's search_workspace tool searches + cites). Shows an "N indexed" chip; click to clear. Adds a folder icon. Hidden on web/iframe (no desktop shell).
- 5c8bbf2: Add WorkspaceIndex — on-device BM25 retrieval across many documents, returning per-source citations. The reusable core for local "workspace RAG": the host feeds it plain text extracted from local files, and it retrieves relevant passages across all of them without anything leaving the machine.

### Patch Changes

- ff34aac: Agent loop correctness: a sub-task that calls no tool is now marked failed (not a false success); the executor uses native tool-calling instead of an XML convention it never parsed; the destructive create_document tool is excluded from sub-task executors; and reflection only accepts structured corrective tasks (no prose-to-task garbage) with dedup against existing steps.
- fd01cb3: The agent planner can now be grounded with a document snapshot (AgentOptions.planningContext) so it decomposes a goal against real structure — the docs panel supplies the heading outline, preventing e.g. a "summarize" goal from being planned as edit sub-tasks.
- 44a225d: The agent's per-task loop now stops when the model repeats the identical tool call two rounds in a row, instead of burning the whole round budget re-calling the same tool with no progress — a common small-local-model failure.
- afd73f7: Attribute AI-triggered document edits and comments to the initiating user (e.g. "Alice via AI") instead of a hardcoded "DocOps AI", so co-editors can tell who ran an AI action in a shared document.
- 9c831c4: Show an "asking AI" presence chip: useCollab now exposes `aiEditingBy` (the peer who triggered the running AI request) alongside `aiIsEditing`, and PresenceCluster renders a small chip naming the requester or a generic "AI is editing…" when the name is unknown or it's the local user.
- d5c9c17: Auto-hyperlink: typing a URL (http(s):// or www.) followed by a space now turns it into a link automatically (Word/Google Docs autoformat), and pasting a bare URL over selected text wraps the selection in a link to that URL instead of replacing the text.
- 65f3715: Auto-list: typing a list marker at the start of a paragraph followed by a space now converts it to a list (Word/Google Docs autoformat) — `-`, `*`, or `+` start a bullet list; `1.` or `1)` start a numbered list. A marker mid-paragraph is left alone.
- a8fa09f: Map CJK fonts (Microsoft JhengHei/YaHei, PMingLiU/MingLiU) to Noto + PingFang fallback stacks so Chinese/Japanese/Korean documents render in a proper CJK face with canonical 1em ideograph advances instead of an arbitrary browser fallback.
- 84ac411: Fix `useClipboard` so paste-as-plain-text (⌘/Ctrl+Shift+V) works. The hook read `shiftKey` off the paste `ClipboardEvent`, which carries no keyboard-modifier state, so the flag was always false. The Shift state is now captured on the paste-initiating keydown (via the hook's `handleKeyDown`) and consumed in the paste handler.
- 59270c8: Fix the color picker dropdown being unreadable in dark mode. Its section labels ("Theme Colors", "Standard Colors", "Custom Color"), the "Automatic" row, and borders used hardcoded light-mode grays (#666 / #333 / #d0d0d0) on a `--doc-surface` background that goes dark under `[data-theme="dark"]` — dark-grey-on-dark. They now use theme tokens (`--doc-text-muted`, `--doc-text-on-surface`, `--doc-border`) so the picker is legible in both themes.
- 01557f4: Add a `mentionableUsers` prop so the host can supply the people directory for comment @-mentions. Previously the @-mention typeahead only knew about people who had already commented, so you couldn't mention a collaborator who hadn't participated yet. Hosts (e.g. Drive) can now pass the known users; they're merged into the suggestion list and deduped against historical authors.
- 2fe0382: Render grouped "Straight Connector" line shapes (prst="line") as a thin rule instead of a content-height filled box. A line shape with a fill (e.g. a gray divider under a header logo) was given an empty placeholder paragraph plus default text-box insets, inflating the ~1px line into a tall colored bar.
- d1336f2: Add Casual Office copyright headers to first-party source files.
- 30556e4: In dark mode, dim the default white page to a soft off-white and deepen the desk behind it to near-black, so the page reads as a calm card instead of glaring. Display-only — documents with an explicit page color are unchanged, and export keeps the real colors.
- 8d1ffbc: Fix endnotes and footnote/endnote tooltips becoming unreadable in dark mode. Both rendered document text with a hardcoded dark color on a `--doc-surface` background, which swaps to a dark value under `[data-theme="dark"]` — black-on-dark, invisible. They now use the page's paper background, matching the document content they belong to.
- 5934c60: The plan→execute→reflect agent now runs on the desktop local model. DesktopTransport was drivesLoop=true, which hid the Agent toggle (gated on !drivesLoop) so the agent only ever ran on the cloud key path. It now does a single model turn per call() — like DirectTransport — and the panel/agent drives the tool loop, matching the panel's existing "Direct / Desktop" flat-loop branch.
- d14685a: EMF/WMF/EPS images now render a labeled placeholder card instead of a broken image. (Ported alongside the desktop-bridge integration.)
- 56fd752: The iframe embed runtime now reads the `cspNonce` URL param at startup and stamps it onto the stylesheets the editor injects while mounting, so strict-CSP hosts (`style-src 'nonce-<value>'`) don't drop the editor's parse-time styles.
- 9ed65cc: Equation authoring foundation: the math node now carries an optional LaTeX source + MathML, the painter renders authored equations directly from their MathML, and on save the MathML is converted to native OMML (`<m:oMath>`/`<m:oMathPara>`) via a new dependency-free MathML→OMML converter — so equations authored in the editor round-trip into the .docx as real math, never images. (The Insert → Equation UI lands next.)
- 6cdb5ad: Edit an existing equation: double-click a rendered equation (or select it and reopen Insert → Equation / Alt+=) to reopen the equation dialog prefilled with its LaTeX, and inserting replaces it in place.
- 3597035: Disabling a feature now vetoes its command, not just its toolbar button. When `features={{ bold: false }}` (and likewise italic/underline/strikethrough), the keyboard shortcut (e.g. Ctrl+B) is a no-op and `DocxEditorRef.executeCommand('bold' | 'toggleBold')` returns `false` without mutating the document — matching the hidden button.
- 0079ec3: Add **File → Version history** to the menu bar (and the command palette). Version history already existed in the side rail, but Google-Docs users look for it under File — it was effectively undiscoverable there. The entry opens the existing version-history panel.
- a66a7e9: Find & Replace now highlights every match in the document (and marks the current match distinctly), matching Google Docs. Highlights clear when the find bar closes.
- 0987a86: Fix Find & Replace: Replace and Replace All now actually change the document (and are undoable as one step). Previously the replacement was routed through the post-transaction change-notification path and never re-seeded the editor, so clicking Replace did nothing.
- 3d57013: Find & Replace now searches and replaces inside table cells. The search is ProseMirror-native (it walks the document, including cells) instead of the old Document-model search that skipped tables; replacements are targeted, undoable transactions, and Find navigation selects each match.
- 7049b20: find_text now matches any textblock (headings, list items, …), not only paragraph nodes — consistent with get_block. It previously missed text in non-paragraph blocks, so the model could locate a block by other means and then get "not found" from find_text.
- 6cd4966: Auto-link no longer swallows trailing sentence punctuation: typing "see http://example.com." links the URL but leaves the period (and trailing `,;:!?` or an unbalanced `)]}`) as plain text, while keeping balanced parens like `…/Foo_(bar)` intact.
- d33dc0e: Fix two production-grade defects surfaced by a code audit:
  - Autosave durability: a save requested while another was in flight (interval tick racing a tab-close flush) was silently dropped, and a hung `FileSource.save()` could deadlock all future autosaves. The hook now coalesces requests through a drain loop so a flush is never lost, and bounds each save with a 30s timeout so a stalled host can't pin the in-flight guard.
  - Image OOXML fidelity: images extracted from a group / `mc:AlternateContent` envelope now carry their captured `rawXml`/`envelopeKey` (plus `wp14` relative-size hints and the hyperlink rId) through the ProseMirror round-trip, so a from-PM rebuild (collab sync, full repack) re-emits the drawing verbatim instead of dropping it. The envelope is cleared on edit so geometry/format changes still persist.

- f7810b3: Fix Find & Replace leaving a stale highlight after the last match is replaced. Replacing the final occurrence cleared the result but left the previous match still highlighted on the page; the highlight is now cleared when no matches remain, matching the search path's behaviour.
- bf8ff2f: Fix the version-history row's three-dot (kebab) menu opening off-screen / in a non-obvious spot: the RightDockPanel retained a resting transform that made it the containing block for the menu's fixed positioning (and clipped it via overflow:hidden). The fixed-dropdown helper now also positions synchronously and right-anchors without a width-measuring frame, removing a one-frame flash.
- 464a487: Harden two editing/collaboration paths found by a code audit:
  - Pasting an image re-reads the insertion point from the live selection for each file and clamps it to the current document size, so a document change during the async file read (user typing, a collab peer's edit, or a previous paste in the same batch) can no longer insert at a stale position or throw a range error.
  - A remote peer's cursor data is treated as untrusted: each peer is parsed in isolation when computing strict co-editing locks, so one malformed cursor payload can't break lock computation for everyone else in the room.

- 886cddd: Fix Export as PDF / Print using the print dialog's default paper size instead of the document's page size. The print stylesheet pinned `@page { size: auto }`, so an A4 (or landscape) document could export at Letter size with clipped or mis-margined pages. The page box is now pinned to the document's actual page dimensions (read from the rendered page), matching WYSIWYG.
- daf2194: Add the missing `star` icon to the icon map so the "named version" badge in version history renders its amber star instead of a blank gap.
- 759e46a: Table appearance controls (border, border color, border width, cell fill) now live in the Format (properties) panel instead of being appended to the formatting toolbar when the caret enters a table. The toolbar's table group keeps only the style gallery and the table-actions menu; the appearance pickers move to the panel — the single home for object appearance.
- eb11782: Fix "Select column" selecting the wrong cells in tables containing merged (colspan) cells. The command treated the visual column index as a cell child index, so any row with a colspan cell before the target column mis-mapped; it now walks each row accumulating colspan to find the cell covering the target column.
- e058c0e: Fix the version-history "show changes" preview placing erased text at the bottom of the document. When the words removed between two versions were at the end of a paragraph (the paragraph break itself unchanged), the struck-through deletion was anchored at the document end instead of in place. It now anchors at the end of the paragraph the text was erased from.
- 2027124: Fix the vertical ruler's top/bottom margin marker staying pinned while the page reflowed when dragged. The marker read initialSectionProperties (sections[0].properties) but margin drags only update finalSectionProperties, so on any document with a section the marker didn't follow the pointer. It now reads the live finalSectionProperties, matching the horizontal ruler.
- 137bf00: Add text-color and highlight pickers to the on-selection format bar (MobileFormatBar, mobile + desktop). After B/I/U/S and Link, a divider then compact (non-split) color and highlight pickers that open the standard palette and apply to the selection via the same handler as the main toolbar — completing the Word-style mini toolbar.
- cc5ea4a: Add a Link button to the on-selection format bar (MobileFormatBar, mobile + desktop variants). After Bold/Italic/Underline/Strikethrough, a divider then a link button opens the hyperlink dialog for the current selection — matching Google Docs' selection toolbar. Uses the existing format handler and the bar's correct selection-anchored positioning.
- ec70b72: Format painter now supports Google-Docs-style persistent mode: double-click the paint-format button to apply the copied formatting to multiple selections in a row (until Escape or another click). A single click stays one-shot.
- c4f2838: Add Google Docs paragraph-alignment shortcuts: Ctrl+Shift+L / E / R / J (left / center / right / justify) now work alongside the existing Word-style Ctrl+L / E / R / J.
- 178232f: Ctrl+] / Ctrl+[ now indent / outdent a plain paragraph (Google Docs), not just list items — they bump the list level inside a list and adjust the paragraph indent otherwise.
- 36440de: Keep grammar-check off the typing hot path. It used to re-scan the whole document on every keystroke (~12ms extra per edit on a 2,500-paragraph doc, enough to drop frames); now it maps existing decorations through each change and only re-scans ~350ms after typing pauses. Squiggles stay responsive without making large documents feel laggy to type in.
- 3d1c49a: Fix the inline header/footer editor rendering on a dark app surface in dark mode. Double-clicking a header to edit it painted the overlay with `--doc-surface` (which is dark under `[data-theme="dark"]`) and inherited light text — so the header turned black, default text became invisible, and transparent logos showed only their opaque pixels. The overlay now uses the page's paper colors (`#fff` / `#000`), matching the body, in every theme.
- bdc1f33: Fix decorative divider rules rendering as thick black bars when editing a header/footer. In the inline header editor, a filled text box with no text (a hairline rule, common in letterheads) got the default text-box chrome — a content-growing min-height, 8px padding, and a 1px border — ballooning a thin rule into a black bar. Such rules now render at their declared thin height with no padding or border. (Phase 2 of the header-edit positioned-layout work.)
- 4e1e6ba: Render positioned header/footer content faithfully while editing. Previously, double-clicking a header with anchored text boxes or a floating logo (e.g. an SDS letterhead) linearized everything into inline flow — boxes stacked and the logo jumped to the wrong side. The inline editor now places those boxes and the logo at the positions the view already computed, by copying the (hidden but laid-out) view geometry through a scoped stylesheet. Simple headers and round-trip are unchanged; positioned content is faithful but not yet drag-editable.
- b649196: Fix the `End` key swallowing the next keystrokes while editing a header/footer. In the inline header editor, native `End` desynced ProseMirror's selection from the DOM (in the clipped overlay) and silently dropped the following input — so a user who pressed End then typed lost their text. `End` now maps to a ProseMirror command that moves the caret to the end of the current textblock, keeping the selection valid; the overlay also no longer lets PM scroll its ancestors to reveal the selection.
- ae0a163: Fix `PageDown` swallowing the next keystrokes while editing a header/footer (same class as the earlier `End` fix). Native `PageDown` in the clipped overlay desynced ProseMirror's selection and dropped the following input. `PageDown`/`PageUp` now move the caret to the end/start of the header content (there is no "page" in a header), keeping the selection valid.
- b663792: Add Google Docs heading shortcuts: Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+1/2/3 apply Heading 1/2/3 and Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+0 reverts to Normal text.
- 1dd11ab: Fix Home/End navigation. Home and End now move the caret to the start/end of the current visual line, and Ctrl/Cmd+Home/End move it to the document start/end (Shift extends the selection in both cases). Previously these were no-ops because the off-screen editing model's native Home/End didn't map to the paginated view.
- e9cfbb0: Internationalize the always-visible status chrome that still hard-coded English: the title-bar save indicator ("Saving…" / "Unsaved changes" / "All changes saved"), the Writing Assistant status pill (all lifecycle labels, with interpolated progress/timing), and the status-bar reading-time and unknown-readability labels. New keys fall back to English in untranslated locales.
- 881c154: Inline markdown autoformat: typing `*italic*` or `**bold**` applies the mark and removes the asterisks (standard Markdown convention). Spaced asterisks like `2 * 3` are left alone so arithmetic isn't affected. `_` is intentionally not used (avoids snake_case false positives).
- ede7c21: Cut redundant page-shell style writes on every keystroke in large documents. Typing earlier in a document shifts every later page's content positions, which flagged all pages as "changed" and re-applied geometry styles to each (~5ms per keystroke on a 300-page doc). The incremental renderer now re-applies a page's size styles only when the size actually changed, and rewrites its page-number attribute only when it moved.
- 0be037e: Markdown heading shortcut: typing `# `, `## `, or `### ` at the start of a plain paragraph applies Heading 1/2/3 (Google Docs / Notion autoformat). It sets the real paragraph style with the document's resolved heading formatting, so the heading appears in the document outline and round-trips — not just direct bold/size formatting.
- c9b696d: Configured MCP servers now persist across reloads (reconnected on mount) and the add-server UI accepts an optional auth token (sent as a Bearer header), so authenticated MCP servers are usable and don't need re-adding every session.
- f0ace82: MCP Streamable-HTTP transport now reads `text/event-stream` responses incrementally instead of buffering the whole body, so it no longer hangs against spec-compliant streaming MCP servers. Also captures the `Mcp-Session-Id` for stateful servers, sends the protocol-version header, follows `tools/list` pagination, and aborts in-flight requests on close.
- a4f4f53: HttpMcpTransport gains a proxyUrl option: when set, MCP JSON-RPC is POSTed to a same-origin CORS proxy (e.g. the collab server's /api/mcp-proxy) as { url, headers, body } and forwarded server-side, so the web editor can reach external MCP servers that don't send CORS headers. Direct connections are unchanged.
- c78e110: Output from external MCP servers is now labeled as untrusted before it reaches the model, so a malicious server can't inject instructions that the agent would act on with real document tools. Built-in tool output is unaffected.
- 65b49fe: The DocOps panel now routes external MCP connections through the same-origin /api/mcp-proxy when running on the web (browsers can't reach most MCP servers directly — no CORS); desktop connects directly. Completes the web-MCP path end to end.
- 9e81acc: Fix a large-document typing-latency cliff: the paragraph measure cache is now sized to the document's paragraph count instead of a fixed 5000 entries. Past ~5000 paragraphs the LRU thrashed on every keystroke (a full re-measure pass evicted entries it still needed), so measurement time jumped from ~1ms to ~100ms. A 309-page document now lays out in ~17ms per keystroke instead of ~112ms.
- bbb1644: Fix PageUp / PageDown: they now scroll the editor viewport by ~one page (Google Docs behavior). Previously they did nothing, because the keys were delegated to the off-screen ProseMirror, which scrolls its hidden area rather than the visible paginated pages.
- 95a9509: Stop the paragraph change-tracker from re-counting every paragraph on each keystroke. It now reuses its cached count for plain typing and only re-walks the document when an edit could change the paragraph count (Enter, paste, backspace-merge, doc load). Cuts another ~2.5ms per keystroke on a 2,500-paragraph document.
- 13e1d1e: Stop re-scanning the whole document for paraId uniqueness on every keystroke. The allocator now only does its O(paragraphs) scan on the first edit and on structural edits (Enter, paste, doc load) — plain typing can't add or duplicate a paragraph, so it skips the walk. On a 2,500-paragraph document this cut per-keystroke transaction cost from ~7ms to ~0.1ms, removing typing lag in large documents (independent of spell/grammar).
- b6f3eda: Fix Shift+Click: it now extends the selection from the existing anchor to the clicked point, instead of collapsing the selection to the click. A subsequent drag keeps extending from that anchor.
- 7e9daf5: Skip the DecorationLayer re-sync bump on pure local selection changes (clicks / arrow keys). Only doc edits and meta-only transactions (e.g. collaboration cursor awareness) can change decorations, so bumping on every selection forced a needless PagedEditor + DecorationLayer re-render on every cursor placement — visible as flicker, especially without collaboration. The selection overlay still updates on every selection change.
- 575f385: Theme the smart-chip "@" menu with design tokens so it renders correctly in dark mode (it previously hardcoded a white background).
- 9eb4075: Fix Escape not dismissing the smart-chip "@" menu. The handler updated state with a no-op (`setActive(i => i)`), which React bails out of, so the menu stayed open; it now tracks the dismissed trigger in state so Escape reliably closes it.
- 105212d: Fix the smart-chip "@" menu drifting away from the caret above 100% zoom. It multiplied the already zoom-transformed caret coordinates by the zoom factor again; it now anchors to the caret at any zoom.
- 7ae6a16: Keep spell-check off the typing hot path on large documents. Like the matching grammar change, it now maps existing decorations through each edit and runs the full word re-scan ~350ms after typing pauses, instead of walking the whole document on every keystroke.
- 6fd00ab: Delete/Backspace over a multi-cell table selection now clears the selected cells' contents and keeps the table, matching Word and Google Docs. Previously selecting the whole table and pressing Delete removed the entire table.
- 92857ff: Fix caret placement after inserting a table: the cursor now lands inside the first cell's paragraph (inline content) instead of on the cell boundary, so you can type into the table immediately. Also removes the "TextSelection endpoint not pointing into a node with inline content" console warning.
- 56ade7b: Pressing Tab in the last cell of a table now adds a new row and moves the cursor into it, matching Word and Google Docs, instead of inserting a literal tab character.
- 0666031: Fix ArrowUp/ArrowDown navigation inside tables: vertical arrows now move to the cell directly above/below in the same column instead of jumping sideways into the neighbouring cell. The caret is placed on the nearest visual row in the arrow direction, then at the column closest to the sticky X.
- 1a39321: Fix text boxes clipping multi-line content. A text box whose declared shape height was shorter than its text (common in CJK SDS headers, where 2–3 line boxes declared a ~1-line height) lost the trailing lines to `overflow: hidden`. Text boxes now match Word's fit behavior: `spAutoFit` boxes grow to fit their text, and fixed-size boxes let the text overflow visibly instead of clipping. Decorative divider rules and spacers (no real text) are unchanged.
- e2b4aaf: Use the shared border token for `ToolbarSeparator` instead of a hardcoded `slate` color, so it stays visually consistent with the rest of the toolbar (and with the group dividers) across light/dark themes and any theme retint.
- b403bfb: Fix the version-preview banner ("Viewing … / Restore this version") scrolling away with the document. It now stays pinned to the viewport (portaled into a viewport-height column wrapping the scroll area), so the cue that you're viewing a past version is always visible; the version list stays visible beside the preview.

## 1.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Toolbar polish: tighter color-strip indicator under font-color / highlight / border buttons (was 16×4 px overlapping the icon, now 18×3 px sitting cleanly below with a 1 px breathing gap). Matches Google Docs' visual rhythm and clears the "chunky highlight strip" feedback from the 2026-06-17 demo walkthrough.

## 1.1.6

### Patch Changes

- embed-runtime: forward DocxEditor parse / load errors to the host via `transport.sendError(parse_failed)` so hosts can swap the iframe for a friendly fallback instead of letting the SDK's own red error UI surface to end users.

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- embed-runtime: bundle the tailwind-compiled editor CSS (dist/styles.css) into dist/embed/embed-runtime.css so the iframe's `<link rel="stylesheet">` serves the full editor stylesheet. Without this, every toolbar button stacked vertically with no layout and the canvas painted unstyled.

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- embed-runtime: hide all chrome (toolbar, menubar, panel rail, status bar, ruler, zoom) and lock read-only in preview mode; toggle on viewMode commands.

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- embed-runtime calls `transport.sendReady()` after `sendHello()`. The
  host (CasualEditorIframe) only sends its hello inside `onEditorReady`;
  without an eager `casual.ready` from the iframe, the handshake
  deadlocked and bytes never loaded.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Add `platform: 'browser'` to the embed-runtime tsup config so esbuild
  picks the browser variant of dual-target deps. 1.1.1 bundled deps but
  still grabbed `import { ... } from 'crypto'` from the Node fork of
  nanoid, which the browser can't resolve. Runtime now lands clean.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Bundle React + ProseMirror + all deps into the embed-runtime instead
  of leaving them as external imports. The previous build expected the
  consumer to provide an importmap; consumers like Casual Drive that
  embed via `<iframe src="…/embed.html">` had no way to do that, and
  the bare `import 'react'` failed at runtime in the browser.

  The runtime now ships ~2.8MB self-contained (cached after first load).

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c702b94: Ship the SDK iframe-delivery architecture (Phase 1 of doc 16).

  The existing `<CasualEditor>` direct-mount stays — no breaking change.
  Adds a new `<CasualEditorIframe>` component that renders the editor
  inside a same-origin iframe instead of co-mounting it into the host's
  React tree. CSS isolation, React-runtime isolation, and the
  `React.Activity` init-crash workaround all go away when consumers
  switch from direct-mount to iframe.

  ### What the consumer-facing API looks like

  ```tsx
  import { CasualEditorIframe } from '@casualoffice/docs';

  <CasualEditorIframe
    fileSource={driveFileSource}
    docId={file.id}
    viewMode="preview"           // or "editor"
    embedBasePath="/embed/docs"   // defaults to /embed/docs
    onSelectionChanged={…}
    onError={…}
  />;
  ```

  No iframe, no postMessage, no `EmbedTransport` wiring in the consumer.
  The wrapper owns all of that internally.

  ### Build artifacts

  Three new files in `dist/embed/`:
  - `embed-runtime.mjs` — self-contained ESM bundle that boots the editor
    inside the iframe.
  - `embed-runtime.css` — sibling stylesheet.
  - `embed.html` — minimal HTML document the iframe loads.

  Consumers copy these into their public dir at `embedBasePath` (default
  `/embed/docs`). A Vite plugin (`@casualoffice/docs/vite-plugin`)
  that does the copy ships in v1.1.x; for v1.1.0 the contract is a
  two-line postinstall script:

  ```sh
  mkdir -p web/public/embed/docs
  cp node_modules/@casualoffice/docs/dist/embed/* web/public/embed/docs/
  ```

  ### Wire protocol additions
  - `casual.command.set.viewmode` — live preview ↔ editor toggle.
  - `casual.error` — editor → host fatal-error signal.

  Both are documented in `docs/internal/13-iframe-protocol.md` (extended)
  and `docs/internal/16-sdk-iframe-architecture.md` (new design doc).

  ### What's not in this minor
  - The full ref API (`flushSave`, `getSelection`, `signing.start`) — ships
    in v1.1.x once Drive proves the wire end-to-end.
  - The Vite plugin — v1.1.x.
  - The `CasualSheets` mirror — separate publish of
    `@casualoffice/sheets@0.5.0`.
  - Preview-mode chrome hiding inside the iframe — currently surfaced as
    a `data-view-mode` attribute on the embed root; v1.1.x wires the
    attribute to component-level chrome toggles.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix `format-converter.worker.ts` bundling. The published `dist/`
  referenced `new Worker(new URL('./format-converter.worker.ts',
import.meta.url))` but didn't ship the `.ts` source — any consumer
  whose bundler honours the `new Worker(new URL(...), import.meta.url)`
  pattern at build time (Vite, modern webpack with worker-plugin, esbuild's
  bundler) errored with "Could not resolve entry module
  .../format-converter.worker.ts" before the consumer's app could even
  import a single editor symbol.

  `tsup.config.ts` now adds `format-converter.worker` as its own entry
  (emits `dist/format-converter.worker.mjs` + `.cjs` as siblings to the
  main chunks) and rewrites the runtime URL in the compiled
  `format-converter` chunk from `./format-converter.worker.ts` to
  `./format-converter.worker.mjs` via a `renderChunk` plugin. Consumers'
  bundlers resolve the URL correctly because the file exists in
  `node_modules` at the path the URL points at.

  Existing consumers (Casual Drive in particular) can drop the
  Vite-transform workaround that rewrote the worker construction to a
  no-op once they bump to this version.

  See schnsrw/docx#4 for the original report.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- 56bdee8: Rename published scope from `@eigenpal/docx-js-editor` to `@casualoffice/docs`.

  This fork has diverged substantially from upstream and now ships under a scope the
  maintainer owns on npm. Imports should switch from `@eigenpal/docx-js-editor` to
  `@casualoffice/docs` — every other export shape, type, and subpath is
  unchanged. Workspace internals (`@eigenpal/docx-core`, `@eigenpal/docx-editor-vue`)
  remain on the old scope; they're private and not published.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 26255fa: Add Tools → Explore (A3). Looks up the selection via Wikipedia's
  free REST summary endpoint and shows the page title, extract, an
  "Open in Wikipedia" link, and a "Cite this" button that inserts a
  hyperlink (title → page URL) at the cursor. Loading / not-found /
  error states route through the shared `PanelState` helper.
- a5c9a43: Add Tools → Dictionary + `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+Y` (A4). Looks up the
  selected word via the free public `dictionaryapi.dev` endpoint and
  shows every meaning's part-of-speech + first definition. Loading and
  error states route through the shared `PanelState` helper (its first
  non-empty-state adopter), so the dialog matches the rest of the
  editor's chrome.
- 6a90d59: Add Tools → Translate (A5). Two-column dialog: source / target
  language pickers + swap, original text seeded from the selection,
  translated text on the right, Copy button under the result. Uses
  the free public `api.mymemory.translated.net` endpoint — no API key
  needed for v0. Loading / error states route through `PanelState`
  (its fourth adopter). Whole-document translate is the future follow-up
  that needs a paid provider.
- 5c63ffd: Add Tools → Citations (A6 v0): a local-only citation manager.
  Add-form (author / title / year / URL) on top, list of saved
  entries on the bottom with a shared APA / MLA / Chicago style radio.
  Insert drops the formatted citation text at the cursor and wraps the
  URL substring in a hyperlink mark. Storage is `localStorage` — the
  real `.docx` bibliography-field round-trip is the future follow-up.
- 4d568f0: Add autosave to IndexedDB + restore banner (sheet parity).
  Snapshots the current `.docx` buffer to `casual-docs` / `autosave` /
  `current` on a debounced 30s-idle timer when the doc is dirty. On
  mount, if a record exists and is fresher than 24h, surfaces a
  banner under the toolbar: "Unsaved changes from <name> (X min ago)
  — restore them?" with Restore / Discard. Restore swaps the buffer
  through the same `loadBuffer` path File → Open uses; Discard drops
  the record. Mirrors `services/sheet/apps/web/src/autosave/*`.
- 7c1357a: Add Insert → "Convert selection to table" (B8). The selected
  paragraphs become a table, with delimiter auto-detected (tab →
  comma → one cell per paragraph) so the paste-from-CSV flow works
  without a dialog. Short rows are zero-padded; a trailing empty
  paragraph is added after the table so the cursor has somewhere to
  land next.
- 27e6147: Close B8: Insert → "Convert table to text". Shows only when the
  caret is inside a table; replaces the table with one paragraph per
  row, cells joined by tab. Pairs with the forward conversion's tab
  delimiter so users can flip between text and table without lossy
  reformatting.
- 98ec43b: Add Insert → Shape submenu (C2 v0): four default-styled SVG
  primitives — Rectangle, Ellipse, Line, Arrow — dropped at the cursor
  as inline images. The full drawing canvas is the deferred upgrade;
  this lands the headline action so users can sketch out diagrams
  without leaving the editor. Existing image handles + properties
  dialog let them resize and reposition without further plumbing.

  Side a11y win: `SubMenuItem` in `MenuDropdown` now carries
  `role="menuitem"` so the existing focus-ring rule covers it for
  free and assistive tech announces submenu items correctly.

- 2fa923d: Extend the watermark dialog with the knobs the painter already
  reads: color picker, opacity slider (10–100%), font-size slider
  (48–144px), and rotation slider (-90 to 90°). Defaults still match
  Word (gray, 50%, 96px, -45°) — values that match the default are
  omitted from the persisted watermark so future default changes
  don't get pinned by accident.
- 1919e60: Add Insert → Building blocks (Quick parts): save the current selection
  as a named, reusable snippet and re-insert it later via the dialog.
  Snippets persist in `localStorage` and round-trip arbitrary editor
  content within the schema (PM Slice JSON), not just plain text.
- d862442: Word convention: `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` inserts a page break at the
  cursor. Bound in `PageBreakExtension`'s `onSchemaReady` so hosts
  that drop the page-break node from their schema don't pick up a
  no-op binding. Documented in the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog under
  Editing.
- 236cd3c: Consolidate panel toggles into the right-edge PanelRail (sheet
  pattern). Comments + Version-history buttons are gone from the
  formatting toolbar; the floating Outline button is gone from the
  editor body. All three live in the rail with pressed state + the
  existing Ctrl+Shift+H shortcut (outline), View menu entry (outline),
  and palette entries. Less duplication, fewer accessible-name
  collisions in tests, same affordances.
- 1ddbe4a: Add a thin yellow banner above the editor while in Suggesting mode
  (E3). Matches Google Docs' visual language; the right-side "Switch
  to editing" button flips back. `role="status"` + `aria-live` keeps
  screen-reader announcements polite.
- 74bb1ba: Round-trip fidelity, dark theme, and ODT/MD/TXT export via `@casualoffice/core`.

  **New: ODT / Markdown / plain-text export.** The toolbar's Export menu now offers ODT, Markdown, and plain-text in addition to DOCX. Conversion runs off-thread in a Web Worker bridged to the `@casualoffice/core` WASM converter — added as a new runtime dependency (`@casualoffice/core@^0.1.1`). DOCX export is unchanged and still routes through the editor's own serializer.

  **New: dark theme.** Real dark mode driven by semantic surface CSS variables (`--doc-surface`, `--doc-text-on-surface`, etc.) rather than CSS inversion. View → Theme picks Light / Dark / System, and the choice persists across reloads. Every dialog, dropdown, sidebar, ribbon button, toolbar icon, status bar, and context menu was reviewed and ported off hardcoded light colors. `[data-theme="dark"]` sets `color-scheme: dark` so native form controls follow.

  **New: UX.**
  - Command palette (`⌘⇧P`) with fuzzy search over every menu action.
  - Status bar at the page bottom: page indicator, word/character count, zoom slider, zoom shortcuts (`⌘=` / `⌘-` / `⌘0`).
  - Hover-to-switch menu bar: opening one menu and hovering a sibling trigger immediately switches; arrow keys navigate between menus; one-click swap fixed (was previously a two-click bug from a stacking-context regression).
  - Save status indicator in the title bar (●Unsaved / Saving…) plus a `beforeunload` guard when there are unsaved changes.
  - Phased loading indicator on first file open: "Reading → Parsing → Building layout → Still working" with an elapsed-seconds counter after 1.5 s.
  - File Properties dialog gets section headers (Metadata / File info).
  - Keyboard-shortcut chips in toolbar tooltips (Bold, Italic, Underline, Strike, Link, Super/Subscript, Undo, Redo, Clear formatting, list buttons, indent/outdent).
  - Toolbar gets an Insert Image button next to Link.
  - View menu (zoom in/out/reset, theme picker) and full Edit / Format menus mirrored into the title bar.
  - About dialog brand-aligned with the title bar document icon.
  - First load opens a blank document instead of the upstream sample.

  **Round-trip fidelity fixes** — every fixture in the audit suite now round-trips with zero parse-but-drop tags:
  - Empty self-closing `<w:pBdr/>`, `<w:spacing/>`, `<w:ind/>`, `<w:rPr/>` inside `<w:pPr>` survive via a `presentEmpty` marker on `ParagraphFormatting`.
  - Section properties `<w:pgNumType>`, `<w:formProt>`, `<w:textDirection>` parsed and serialized.
  - `<w:footnotePr/>` and `<w:endnotePr/>` round-trip in their self-closing form when no children are populated.
  - `<w:tblCellMar>` logical-side names (`w:start` / `w:end`) preserved instead of being coerced to `w:left` / `w:right`.
  - Drawing percent-of-anchor hints (`wp14:sizeRelH` / `wp14:sizeRelV` with `pctWidth` / `pctHeight`) parsed into `Image.relativeSize` and re-emitted.
  - Complex fields (`<w:fldChar>` + `<w:instrText>`) inside `<w:ins>` and `<w:del>` no longer dropped — runs stay raw inside tracked context instead of being coalesced into a `ComplexField` the surrounding filter would discard.
  - `<w:highlight w:val="none"/>` (the explicit no-highlight override, ECMA-376 §17.18.40) round-trips instead of being stripped at serialize time.
  - Run border `<w:bdr>` (§17.3.2.4) now modeled on `TextFormatting.border` and round-tripped.
  - `<w:bookmarkEnd>` anchored as a direct child of `<w:tbl>` (Word does this when a range starts inside a cell and closes at the table boundary) survives via `Table.trailingBookmarks`.

- 56d7d26: Add File → "Email as attachment…" (F2). Triggers the same save path
  as Save, downloads the `.docx`, and opens a `mailto:` draft with
  subject + body pre-filled. The browser can't auto-attach files for
  security reasons, so the body and a toast both nudge the user to
  drag the downloaded file into the email window.
- a75c98d: Add View → "Show non-printing characters" (F6): toggles paragraph
  marks (¶), tab arrows (→), and line-break arrows (↵) over the page
  content as CSS pseudo-elements. The marks never enter selections,
  the clipboard, or the saved .docx. State persists in localStorage
  so the preference survives a reload.
- c0df3b5: `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+H` now toggles the document outline panel. The
  floating outline button's tooltip surfaces the shortcut chip, and
  the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog lists it under View. Mac-safe: the
  shifted variant avoids the system-level `Cmd+Option+H` "Hide Others".
- c186c4a: **New: page color (background) support.** Reads the doc-level `<w:background>` element (OOXML §17.2.1) — Word + Google Docs both surface this as "Page color" in their Page Setup UI. The editor now:
  - Parses the element on load and renders pages with the declared color.
  - Round-trips it on save (no more silent drop).
  - Adds a **Page color** picker to the Page Setup dialog, with a **None** reset that clears the background entirely.

  Doc-level background is the standard location; the section-level `<w:background>` already supported earlier still works.

  API: `<PageSetupDialog>` gains optional `currentPageColor` + `onPageColorChange` props. `<DocxEditor>`'s built-in dialog wires both, so embedders get the picker for free.

- 7251269: Command palette is now actually fuzzy — the docstring already
  claimed it. Items are scored on ordered subsequence with a
  word-boundary bonus (`+5` at start / after space / after `>`) and a
  consecutive-match bonus (`+3`); skipped characters between matches
  cost `-1` so a tight run beats a sprawling one. Results sort by
  score, so `expdf` jumps straight to "Export as PDF" and `fr` ranks
  "Find and Replace" first.
- 3ff4cd7: Command palette gains entries for every feature added this session:
  File · Make a copy / Email as attachment; Insert · Watermark /
  Building blocks / Convert selection to table / Shape (Rectangle /
  Ellipse / Line / Arrow); Tools · Word count / Dictionary / Translate /
  Explore / Citations / Preferences / Accessibility; View · Show
  non-printing characters. Cmd+Shift+P now actually finds them.
- 1624ce6: Command palette now remembers your last 5 picks (per browser, via
  `localStorage`). On open with an empty query, recently-used items
  surface at the top in MRU order — so the second time you hunt for
  "Word count" or "Dictionary", you press ⌘⇧P + Enter.
- e2c665d: Add IndexedDB-backed recent files (sheet parity). On `File → Open`,
  DocxEditor records the buffer + name + timestamp into a `recent-files`
  store in the shared `casual-docs` DB (now v2; autosave's store moves
  to a shared opener). Host package exports `recordRecentFile`,
  `listRecentFiles`, `deleteRecentFile`, `formatSize`, and the
  `RecentFile` type. The example Vite app's Home screen surfaces a
  "Recent" section above Featured (when at least one entry exists and
  no template filter is active) — cards re-open by synthesizing a
  `File` from the stored buffer, so the existing `onOpenFile` path
  doesn't need a new code path.

  Retention: 10 entries (oldest evicted), 60-day stale window.
  Mirrors `services/sheet/apps/web/src/recent-files/*`.

- dc6389f: Add CasualEditor SDK wrapper, EmbedTransport for iframe delivery, and the document-signature pipeline.
  - **CasualEditor** — composable React wrapper bundling DocxEditor + FileSource + optional collab + optional autosave. One prop (`backendUrl`) flips standalone↔collab; signing prop opens a signing session with anchored fields. Drive integrators land on this as the primary surface.
  - **useCollab** promoted from the demo into the library. `yjs` / `y-websocket` / `y-prosemirror` ship as optional peer dependencies so standalone consumers don't pay the bundle weight.
  - **EmbedTransport** + protocol types for iframe delivery — postMessage envelopes match `docs/internal/13-iframe-protocol.md`. Validates origin, dispatches by envelope `type`, supports request/response correlation by id.
  - **Signing pipeline** — `SigningProvider` + `SigningPane` + `DrawnSignaturePad` / `TypedSignatureField` / `UploadedSignatureField` capture surfaces. Sequential or concurrent modes. Same payload shapes whether delivered via SDK callbacks or iframe envelopes.
  - Crypto stays out of the editor — the host (Drive's Rust backend) owns identity attestation and audit; the editor stamps whatever bytes the signer produces.

- 350f348: Document the global shortcuts wired in DocxEditor but missing from
  the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog: Search the menus (⌘⇧P), Word count
  (⌘⇧C), Dictionary (⌘⇧Y), Cycle editing mode (⌘⇧E), New comment
  (⌘⌥M), Bullet list (⌘⇧L). The dialog's search field now finds
  them, and ⌘⇧P picks up a `common: true` chip on the common list.
- 74dcaad: Right-click the status bar to toggle which counters appear (Page
  indicator / Word count / Character count / Reading time). Excel-style
  checklist popover, persists in `localStorage` via a small
  `useSyncExternalStore`-backed module. Mirrors
  `services/sheet/apps/web/src/shell/use-statbar-prefs.ts`.
- 5238626: View menu gains a "Show document outline" entry (⌘⇧H chip) with
  a checkmark prefix when open. Pairs with the existing floating
  outline button + global keyboard shortcut so the surface area
  matches Google Docs.
- 89c2ba2: **New: `wordCompat` prop on `<DocxEditor>`.** Opt-in switch for Word-style rendering quirks. Off by default — the renderer stays faithful to the literal OOXML, matching how LibreOffice and Google Docs draw.

  When `true`, the painter emulates Word's "firstRow-only borders close the last body row" behavior (GH #395): when `<w:tblBorders>` declares only `firstRow` styling, Word also draws the firstRow's bottom border on the last cell of the last body row when that cell has no `<w:bottom>` of its own. Useful for hosts building Word-comparison UIs or side-by-side viewers.

  ```tsx
  <DocxEditor wordCompat document={doc} />
  ```

  Threads through `<DocxEditor>` → `<PagedEditor>` → `renderPages` → `RenderContext.wordCompat` — third-party `PagedEditor` users can flip the same prop.

- a491ab5: Add `<PanelState>` (`@eigenpal/docx-js-editor` → `components/ui/PanelState`):
  a shared empty / loading / error helper for side panels. Centered
  layout, muted copy, opt-in Material Symbol icon, and an `ep-spin`
  800ms spinner for the loading variant. ARIA roles auto-pick (status
  vs alert; `aria-live="polite"` on loading). `VersionHistoryPanel`
  migrated as the first adopter — its inline empty-state chrome now
  renders through `<PanelState kind="empty" />`.
- 86486c9: Ship `PanelRail` v0 (X7): always-visible 36px activity bar on the
  right edge with toggles for Outline / Comments / Version history.
  Each button shows its panel's pressed state with a left-edge accent
  marker matching VSCode / Office activity-bar conventions. Mutual
  exclusion between Comments and Version history is shared by both
  the toolbar buttons and the rail via two new memoized callbacks.
  Mirrors the sibling Casual Sheets PanelRail.
- 57e545b: The status-bar zoom readout now opens a 50 / 75 / 100 / 125 / 150 /
  200% presets popover instead of resetting on click. Active preset
  shows a checkmark. ⌘0 still resets, so the old keyboard path is
  unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- 72e9117: Fix: autosave was firing once per dirty rising-edge — continuous
  typing past 30s without an explicit save never snapshotted again.
  Switched from a `setTimeout` keyed on `isDirty` to a 30s
  `setInterval` that polls a dirty ref, so a long editing session
  keeps getting periodic snapshots. Also bumped the existing autosave
  specs to open the IDB at v2 (recent-files added that store).
- a891ab8: Clicking the PanelRail's Comments toggle on an empty doc used to
  flip the rail button to pressed with nothing else visible
  (UnifiedSidebar returns null when items.length === 0). Now it
  surfaces a sonner toast — "No comments yet — select text and click
  'Add comment'." — so the user knows where to start.
- 7b6230a: Add Word count to the Tools menu (D5) — matches Google Docs'
  Tools → Word count placement. The existing Edit-menu entry stays
  in place, so both shortcuts and keyboard navigation continue to
  work either way.
- a9a27cf: Document the existing `Cmd/Ctrl+K` hyperlink shortcut in the
  Keyboard Shortcuts dialog. The binding has been wired for a while
  and the formatting-bar button already shows the chip; this just
  closes the doc gap so the dialog's search field can find it.
- d531a15: Surface the `⌘↵` chip on the Insert → Page break menu entry now
  that the shortcut is bound. Existing chips on Bold / Italic / Save /
  Word count / Dictionary / Show outline already taught users to look
  there; this one was conspicuously absent.
- e788570: Surface the `⌘↵` chip on the palette's "Insert page break" entry
  and add an "Insert link" entry under Edit with the `⌘K` chip
  (replicates the formatting-bar's link button via the existing
  insertLink action). Pairs with the dialog documentation shipped
  in the previous turn.
- 269dc3f: Add `Show / Hide document outline` to the command palette so
  ⌘⇧P → Enter (after a recent pick) toggles the outline with one
  keystroke. Label flips with state.
- ee1d999: Mirror PanelRail's Comments + Version-history toggles into the
  command palette under View. Labels flip with state ("Show" / "Hide"),
  pairing with the existing Outline entry. Cmd+Shift+P + Enter now
  toggles those panels too — same MRU bumping as every other palette
  action.
- 6a74c3d: Fix: PanelRail now sits inside the below-toolbar flex row so it
  spans only the editor body's vertical extent, not the toolbar's.
  Previously it lived at the mainContent level alongside the toolbar
  column, so the rail icons floated up against the title bar instead
  of starting under the formatting bar.

  Also fixes the StatusBar lint errors that CI flagged: the
  status-bar checklist hooks now run before the `!visible` early
  return so React sees a stable hook order regardless of visibility.

- 0301b79: Add a "~N min read" estimate to the status bar, alongside word
  count. Uses a 200-wpm prose-average baseline (the same convention
  Medium uses) and rounds up so the user is more likely to
  over-budget than under. Hidden on empty documents.
- 500025f: Suggesting-mode banner's "Switch to editing" button now shows the
  `⌘⇧E` / `Ctrl+Shift+E` chip — the mode-cycle shortcut walks
  Editing → Suggesting → Viewing → Editing, so the same key gets the
  user back. Surfacing the chip on the button is the same pattern
  the toolbar / menu / shortcuts-dialog use.
- 0dec1f6: Tooltip's `side="left"` and `"right"` were typed but never honored
  in the position math — they silently fell through to `bottom`. The
  PanelRail uses `side="left"` so its tooltips land outside the rail
  column. Anchor + transform now route through one `computeAnchor()`
  that handles all four sides.
- dec42fa: Word count dialog now shows the reading-time estimate (`~N min`)
  alongside the existing pages/words/characters/paragraphs rows —
  matches what the status bar shows so the two stay in sync.
- 8977b10: Close the X3 focus-ring gap: the table hover-insert "+" button now
  shows a keyboard outline (via a new opt-in `.ep-focus-ring` utility
  class), and the Toolbar's heading-style / character-spacing /
  section-break / field submenu items gain `role="menuitem"` so they
  pick up the existing menu-item ring rule. No double-rings — the
  opt-in class avoids the global selectors that risked it.
- f5073a1: Add `--doc-anim-fast` / `--doc-anim-base` / `--doc-anim-slow` CSS
  custom properties on `.ep-root` (100 / 150 / 200ms on Material's
  standard easing) so the editor's animation timings stop drifting
  across components. Lazy dialogs (About, Preferences, Watermark,
  Accessibility, Building blocks) now share an opt-in
  `.ep-dialog-overlay` / `.ep-dialog-shell` fade + subtle scale on open,
  respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- ef2dc9b: Migrate `DocumentOutline`'s no-headings hint to `<PanelState>` — the
  second adopter of the X5 shared helper, replacing the inline empty-
  state chrome with the centered / muted / ARIA-correct version.

## 0.5.1

### Patch Changes

- f7a1060: Fix header/footer table parity issues in paged render and inline editing, including header recreation after removal.
- cbff36e: Resolve themed table-cell border colors (`w:themeColor`) against the document theme so they render correctly in the inline header/footer editor and copied HTML, instead of falling back to the default Office palette.
- 2158433: Add Turkish (tr) translation with 100% coverage.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5fddb75: Image layout modes (Word-style): right-click image menu and toolbar dropdown now share five directional options (In Line with Text · Square Left · Square Right · Behind Text · In Front of Text) plus Cut/Copy/Paste/Delete. Inline ↔ anchor transitions promote inline images to anchored floats at the same rendered position (Word's behavior) and back, with full OOXML round-trip. Layout helpers (`hitTestImage`, `captureInlinePositionEmu`, `deriveLayoutChoice`, `IMAGE_LAYOUT_OPTIONS`, `toolbarValueToLayoutTarget`) are exported from `@eigenpal/docx-core/layout-painter` so framework adapters share them.
- c605277: Close 16 OOXML rendering gaps from the post-PR-#421 audit (#423): vertical anchor `align`, the six unhandled `relativeFrom` variants, bare `wp:positionH/V`, image crop (`wp:srcRect`), transparency (`a:alphaModFix`), `wp:effectExtent` shadow padding, rotation pivot, `layoutInCell` / `allowOverlap` round-trip, `w:vanish` / `w:rtl` / `w:effect` per-run, `w:trHeight hRule="exact"` enforcement, and `w:noWrap` on cells. `w:framePr` and `w:cols`-with-anchored-images are preserved on round-trip; visual rendering of those is left as a documented follow-up.

### Patch Changes

- aefb8c6: Serialize all integer-typed OOXML attributes (EMU and twips) as integers. Floating-point drift from arithmetic like `inches * 1440` (e.g. `0.7 * 1440 === 1008.0000000000001`) or `(px / 96) * 914400` (e.g. `cy="495299.99999999994"`) caused saved files to fail to open in Microsoft Word, even though tolerant readers accepted them. (fixes #417)

  Behavior changes for callers:
  - `pixelsToEmu`, `twipsToEmu`, and `emuToTwips` now round their result to the nearest integer. Previously they could return values like `495299.99999999994`.
  - `createEmptyDocument` rounds `pageWidth`, `pageHeight`, and all `margin*` options to integer twips at the API boundary.
  - `InsertImageCommand` (`agent.insertImage`) now correctly converts `width` / `height` from pixels to EMU. Previously it multiplied pixels by 914400 instead of 9525, producing images 96× the requested size (a 100 px image became a 96-inch image). Default 100 px now produces a ~1.04-inch image, matching the documented behavior.

  Defensive: every integer-typed XML attribute in the document, paragraph, table, and run serializers now coerces its value to an integer at write time, so fractional values reaching the serializer through any code path can no longer corrupt the saved file.

- b6c26db: Render `wp:wrapNone` anchored images (`behind` / `inFront`) as positioned floats instead of block images. They no longer consume paragraph flow height or create text-wrap exclusion zones, matching Word's behavior.

## 0.4.3

### Patch Changes

- 5fd14f9: Fix selection highlights bleeding from body into headers and footers. When body and header content shared low PM positions (because each is parsed as a separate ProseMirror document), the DOM-based selection painter matched both trees and drew phantom rectangles on every header and footer. Selection rectangles and caret lookups are now scoped to `.layout-page-content`.
- 11abc2d: Four header/footer fidelity follow-ups from the unification refactor:
  - **#379** — `RenderContext.positioning` controls renderer outer position. `renderTableFragment` and `renderParagraphFragment` now pick `position: absolute` vs `position: relative` based on context, so HF / textbox callers don't have to flip inline styles after the fact. Removes the post-render `style.position` flips at three call sites.
  - **#380** — Inline-vs-inherited paragraph spacing strip. `normalizeHeaderFooterMeasureBlocks` now strips `spaceBefore` / `spaceAfter` ONLY when they were resolved from a paragraph style (e.g. Normal's default 8pt-after) and not specified inline on the HF paragraph itself. Inline `<w:spacing>` is preserved per ECMA-376 §17.3.1.33; previously the blanket strip collapsed intentional Word spacing.
  - **#381** — Trailing empty paragraph after a table renders at zero height. OOXML requires a trailing block-level element after the last `<w:tbl>` (the canonical convention is an empty `<w:p/>`). Word renders that paragraph as a zero-height anchor; we previously added `~14pt` of phantom space. The new `suppressEmptyParagraphHeight` flag on `ParagraphAttrs` opts the empty paragraph out of the default empty-line height fallback during measurement, while keeping the block itself for click-to-position.
  - **#382** — Floating tables (`<w:tblpPr>`) honor `tblpX` / `tblpY` in headers/footers. New `resolveHeaderFooterFloatingTablePosition` resolves the anchor (`page` / `margin` / `text`) per ECMA-376 §17.4.57 and positions the table at the requested coordinates instead of inline at `cursorY`. Floating tables don't advance `cursorY` — surrounding HF blocks flow as if the table weren't there, matching Word's no-wrap behavior.

  `normalizeHeaderFooterMeasureBlocks` extracted into its own file to enable unit testing.

  Closes #379, #380, #381, #382.

- 0d3581d: Set package homepage to https://docx-editor.dev/.
- 4e194d7: Inline images in table cells now have visual breathing room. Previously when an image was taller than the parent paragraph's text line height, the line height was overwritten with the bare image height — so an image alone in a table cell rendered flush with the cell borders. Word treats an inline image as a tall glyph sitting on the text baseline: the image extends above the baseline (full ascent) and the line still reserves the parent font's normal descent + leading below. The line now grows to image-height + text-line-height, giving cells natural padding around image-dominant lines.
- e12c337: Footnote rendering now routes through the body pipeline (`footnoteToProseDoc → toFlowBlocks → measureBlocks`), eliminating the shadow stack in `footnoteLayout.ts`. Footnotes inherit the full block-kind support of the body — paragraph, table, image, textBox, fields. Pre-PR a footnote that contained a table silently dropped the table; same for inline images and PAGE/NUMPAGES fields.

  The fix mirrors the header/footer unification (#356/#357/#358):
  - **Parser:** `parseFootnote` and `parseEndnote` now walk all child blocks (`<w:p>` + `<w:tbl>`) in document order. The `Footnote.content` and `Endnote.content` types widen from `Paragraph[]` to `(Paragraph | Table)[]` to match the body / HeaderFooter / TableCell shape and reflect ECMA-376 §17.11.10.
  - **Converter:** new `footnoteToProseDoc` next to `headerFooterToProseDoc`; takes `(Paragraph | Table)[]` and produces a PM doc using the same `convertParagraphWithTextBoxes` / `convertTable` machinery the body uses.
  - **Render adapter:** `convertFootnoteToContent` and `buildFootnoteContentMap` move from `core/layout-bridge/footnoteLayout.ts` to `react/.../PagedEditor.tsx`, parallel to `convertHeaderFooterToContent`. Footnote-specific presentation (default 8pt font, prepended display number as superscript) lives as a small post-process layer (`applyFootnotePresentation`).
  - **Cleanup:** `footnoteLayout.ts` shrinks from 293 lines to ~80 — only the page-mapping helpers remain (`collectFootnoteRefs`, `mapFootnotesToPages`, `calculateFootnoteReservedHeights`).

  Refs #378.

- 4aee2e0: Consolidate body-scoped `data-pm-start` DOM lookups behind `findBodyPmSpans` / `findBodyEmptyRuns` / `findBodyPmAnchors` / `findBodyPmAnchor` helpers in `@eigenpal/docx-core/layout-bridge`. Removes the lingering risk that body-only operations (caret resolution, selection painting, scroll restore, image `NodeSelection` lookup, sidebar anchor positioning, visual-line navigation) accidentally match a header or footer run whose ProseMirror position collides with a body position. Same bug class as #391; this finishes the cleanup started in #406.
- 274d858: Run-level OOXML attributes that were already parsed and held as ProseMirror marks now reach the painted DOM. The layout-bridge's `extractRunFormatting` had no `case` arm for several run-level marks, so the visible renderer silently dropped them while the hidden ProseMirror `toDOM` rendered them correctly:
  - **`w:caps` (§17.3.2.4) — `allCaps`** — uppercase styling on heading runs is no longer lowercased.
  - **`w:smallCaps` (§17.3.2.32) — `smallCaps`** — small-caps styling reaches the painted DOM.
  - **`w:position` (§17.3.2.24)** — baseline shift in half-points now applies as `vertical-align`.
  - **`w:w` (§17.3.2.43)** — horizontal text scale (e.g. 90% tracking on branded templates) applies as a `transform: scaleX(...)` on an inline-block.
  - **`w:kern` (§17.3.2.18)** — kerning threshold gate enables `font-kerning: normal` when the run's font size is at or above the threshold.

  The four `w:position` / `w:w` / `w:kern` properties share a single PM mark (`characterSpacing`) with a multi-attribute container; previously only its `spacing` attribute was bridged, so the other three sat in the model unread.

  Refs #410.

  Also propagates the cosmetic-effect marks (`emboss`, `imprint`, `textShadow`, `textOutline`, `emphasisMark`) which were the same defect class — PM marks parsed correctly but the layout-bridge had no `case` arm, so painted runs lost the effect. Each maps to the same CSS recipe the hidden PM `toDOM` uses, so editable + painted views stay visually identical.

  Adjacent fix for #392: paragraph runs without an explicit `fontFamily` mark now inherit the paragraph's resolved style font (from the basedOn → docDefaults cascade) instead of falling back to the painter's hardcoded Calibri stack. Same mechanism applies to `fontSize` — runs that don't override fall through to the paragraph's resolved default. Closes the per-run side of the rFonts cascade gap from #412.

  Refs #410, #412, fixes #392.

- 7ff0b6f: Fix style-cascade gaps for runs without an explicit `<w:rStyle>` and tables without an explicit `<w:tblStyle>`. Per ECMA-376 §17.7.4.18, both should inherit from the document's default style of the same type (the one marked `w:default="1"`); pre-PR the default character style was skipped entirely (only docDefaults.rPr reached such runs), and the table-borders cascade was hardcoded to look up styleId `"TableGrid"` instead of the parsed default flag.
  - `StyleResolver.getDefaultCharacterStyle()` finds the default by `w:default="1"` flag (varies by language: "Default Paragraph Font", "FontePadrao", "Fontepargpadro", etc.).
  - `resolveRunStyle()` now applies the cascade `docDefaults.rPr → default character style → explicit character style`, matching the cellMargins / paragraph cascade pattern.
  - `resolveTextFormatting()` no longer short-circuits when a run has no `styleId` — it always consults the full cascade.
  - Table borders cascade replaces the hardcoded `getStyle('TableGrid')` with `getDefaultTableStyle()`, matching the cellMargins cascade and working for documents whose default table style has any styleId.

  5 new unit tests cover the default character style cascade and the `getDefaultCharacterStyle()` helper. All 449 core tests pass (was 445).

  Refs #412.

- 4e194d7: Three Word-fidelity fixes surfaced by the Metal Nobre "DC_Template_Descricao_Cargo" template:
  - **Inline images no longer overflow their containing line.** Browsers compute a non-integer height for `<img>` from the natural aspect ratio when only `width`/`height` attributes are set, which clipped images sized in EMU (e.g. wp:extent `1771650×278918` rounds to `186×29` px but the natural ratio gave `29.29` px). Width/height are now also pinned via inline style, and the inline-image vertical alignment is the default `baseline` rather than `middle` — `middle` adds half-x-height of parent-font leading and pushed the image past the bottom of any line sized to fit just the image (the typical "image alone in a table cell" case).
  - **Explicit `w:before` is honored on the first paragraph of a page/column.** The paginator was unconditionally zeroing `spaceBefore` whenever the cursor was at `topMargin`, which dropped Word-authored leading space (e.g. `w:before="1800"` on the title paragraph). Word 2013+ honors explicit before-spacing at the top of a page; trailing-spacing is already reset on new-page so applying it here does not carry spacing across page breaks.
  - **A hard `<w:br w:type="page"/>` in an otherwise-empty paragraph now forces a page break.** `paragraphHasPageBreak` previously required preceding visible content (relying on `renderedPageBreakBefore` to cover leading breaks), but that attr is informational only and not honored at layout, so an empty paragraph containing just a page-break run silently dropped the break.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 4425996: Fix `apply_formatting` tool schema rejection by Gemini. The `marks.highlight` enum no longer contains an empty string, which Gemini's `GenerateContentRequest` rejects. Pass `"none"` to clear the highlight.
- 2442eb4: Fix footer overflowing into body content on documents with tracked-change footers (or any footer taller than the authored bottom margin). The auto-extend that pushes body content up to make room for an oversized footer was applied to the document-level fallback margins but not to per-section margins carried on section breaks. The layout engine prefers section-break margins, so the extension was getting overridden and the footer rendered on top of body text. Section-break and final-section margins now also extend.
- ff6dbe8: Fix header/footer interactions in the inline editor: toolbar now reflects table state when the cursor is in a header/footer table cell, right-click shows the table context menu, and the horizontal/vertical rulers stay above the inline HF editor on scroll instead of being painted over. Fixes #384, #385.
- 811bf2c: Fix layout for documents with mixed sections and complex tables. Fixes #319.
  - Documents that mix portrait and landscape sections render with each section's own page size, margins, and columns instead of forcing every page to the body default.
  - Paragraphs that follow `<w:lastRenderedPageBreak/>` (the marker Word writes when it lays out a doc) no longer collapse onto the previous page on first load. The marker survives save+reload at its original position.
  - A section break immediately followed by a `pageBreakBefore` paragraph (e.g. an "Attachment" heading after a section change) no longer leaves a blank page between the body and the heading.
  - Tables with auto-fit grids, zero-width grid columns, or sparse single-cell rows render with correct column widths instead of collapsing or stretching.
  - Tables with vertically merged columns (`vMerge`) or explicit `gridSpan` no longer have continuation cells incorrectly expanded to span the full row.
  - A section override of only `marginRight` or `marginBottom` is now honored; unset sides inherit from the prior section instead of resetting to the OOXML 1440 default.
  - Paragraph spacing inside table cells is applied during measurement and rendering.
  - An oversized paragraph or image (taller than the page content area, possibly after a continuous section break to a smaller page size) is placed with overflow instead of hanging the paginator.

- a2f6342: Trim verbose comments and dead test scaffolding left over from #334.
- e32ebed: Fix list numbering when multiple `<w:num>` elements share one `<w:abstractNum>`. Per ECMA-376 §17.9.18 they share counter state and a `<w:lvlOverride>/<w:startOverride>` only resets the shared counter the first time its numId appears. Counter state is now keyed by abstractNumId; first-encounter resets are honored. Also fixes a related justification bug where list-level indents written with `<w:ind w:start="0"/>` were ignored, causing a 720-twip fallback indent to be applied and table-cell text to render 48px short of the cell width.
- 7a2665c: Fix font reset on save when a paragraph style explicitly sets `<w:rFonts ascii="Arial">` while document defaults supply a paired `asciiTheme="minorHAnsi"`. The OOXML render layer treats the theme attribute as overriding the explicit name, so a stale `asciiTheme` from `docDefaults` was silently turning Arial headings into Calibri. The font merge now treats explicit/theme attribute pairs as a unit per ECMA-376 §17.3.2.27. Fixes #387.
- f42ad91: Fix paragraph default font family resolution when a paragraph's pPr/rPr sets only one slot of `<w:rFonts>` (e.g. `w:eastAsia="Calibri"`). Previously the entire fontFamily object was replaced on merge, wiping out other slots inherited from the basedOn chain (e.g. `w:ascii="Arial Narrow"`). Per ECMA-376 §17.3.2.27, each ascii/hAnsi/eastAsia/cs slot — and its theme pair — must merge independently. Identical paragraphs now resolve to the same default font family and render at the same height.
- e89e859: Translate the floating page indicator (the "current of total" widget that appears next to the scrollbar while scrolling a multi-page document). It was rendering the literal string `" of "` regardless of the active locale. Fixes #399. New `viewer.pageIndicator` translation key (`"{current} of {total}"`) routes through the same `i18n` prop as the rest of the UI. Also fills in the four remaining `null` keys in `he.json` (`toolbar.open`, `toolbar.openShortcut`, `toolbar.save`, `toolbar.saveShortcut`) so all six shipped locales (de, en, he, pl, pt-BR, zh-CN) are at 100% coverage.
- 5454bb2: Fix paragraph wrappers double-counting `spaceBefore`/`spaceAfter` in the renderer. The paginator already positions `fragment.y` with the gap baked in, but the renderer was also applying it as wrapper padding. Wrapper height is set to line-height only, so the padding pushed text below the wrapper bottom and the next paragraph's background covered the bottom half of the heading text. Symptom on real-world docs: top half of `Dev setup` heading missing — covered by the lavender background of the code block immediately following.
- 1259fa0: Unify header/footer rendering with the body pipeline. Header tables now render in the normal paginated view (previously they were silently dropped on the paginated render path while showing in edit mode), and headers/footers gain full block-kind support — paragraphs, tables, images, text boxes, and PAGE/NUMPAGES fields — by routing through the same `headerFooterToProseDoc → toFlowBlocks → measureBlocks → renderFragment` chain the body uses. Fixes #356, #357, #358.
- f6703d0: Add Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) translation.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- bc02218: Fix long unbroken text overflowing page margins (#334). The page-level CSS default font (`Calibri, "Segoe UI", Arial, sans-serif`) didn't match the canvas measurement fallback (`Calibri, Carlito, ...`), so when Carlito loaded as a web font, line widths were measured against Carlito but rendered against Arial — causing strings like `asdfasdfasdf...` to extend past the right margin. Both sides now use the same `resolveFontFamily('Calibri')` chain.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 159cad2: **Curated subpath exports + peerDeps move.** Replaces the `./*` wildcard on `@eigenpal/docx-core` with 17 explicit, tree-shakeable subpaths:
  - Top level: `.`, `./headless`, `./core-plugins`, `./mcp`
  - ProseMirror: `./prosemirror`, `./prosemirror/extensions`, `./prosemirror/conversion`, `./prosemirror/commands`, `./prosemirror/plugins`, `./prosemirror/editor.css`
  - DOCX I/O: `./docx`, `./docx/serializer`
  - Headless agent: `./agent`
  - Layout (`@experimental`): `./layout-engine`, `./layout-painter`, `./layout-bridge`, `./plugin-api`
  - Types: `./types/document`, `./types/content`, `./types/agentApi`
  - Utilities: `./utils`

  **Breaking change for consumers**: `prosemirror-*` packages are now `peerDependencies` (in both `@eigenpal/docx-core` and `@eigenpal/docx-js-editor`) so consumer bundles don't end up with duplicate ProseMirror copies. After upgrading you must install them yourself:

  ```bash
  npm i prosemirror-commands prosemirror-dropcursor prosemirror-history \
        prosemirror-keymap prosemirror-model prosemirror-state \
        prosemirror-tables prosemirror-transform prosemirror-view
  ```

  Also breaks the `schema → StarterKit → extensions → schema` circular import that crashed bundled consumers with `X is not a function`. Extensions now receive their owning `ExtensionManager` via `ExtensionContext.manager` instead of reaching for the module-level `singletonManager`. The `singletonManager` is no longer exported from `./prosemirror` — internal commands still get it via the relative `./schema` path inside the package.

### Patch Changes

- 23a2c7e: Add Hebrew (he) locale

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- e92b349: Fix comments sidebar not repositioning when comments are added programmatically (e.g. via the agent `addComment` ref). Cards no longer overlap until you click one — heights are now re-measured whenever the items list changes, mirroring the existing re-measure pass that runs on expand/collapse.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fe17e73: Add Open and Save entries to the toolbar's File menu (with Ctrl+O / Ctrl+S labels) so users can import and download DOCX files without leaving the editor. New translation keys (`toolbar.open`, `toolbar.openShortcut`, `toolbar.save`, `toolbar.saveShortcut`) are wired through the i18n system and synced across community locales.

### Patch Changes

- 06cdf53: Agent now reads and searches the vanilla document. Previously, `read_document` showed insertions inlined and hid deletions (the resolved view), while the search backing `add_comment` / `suggest_change` flattened both — so a phrase the agent picked from `read_document` often failed to anchor and the bridge returned `null` with no diagnostic. Now both the read view and the search view treat the document as it exists right now: tracked insertions are hidden (not in the doc until accepted) and tracked deletions are visible as plain text (still in the doc until accepted). Anchoring against text the agent actually saw works on first try.
- beee9a4: Translate agent panel UI strings — wires `AgentPanel`, `AgentChatLog`, `AgentTimeline`, and `AgentComposer` through `t()` and ships full translations for `de`, `pl`, and `pt-BR`. Previously `agentPanel.*` keys were `null` in every non-English locale, and the chat primitives hardcoded strings like "Working… N steps", "Assistant is thinking", "Ask the assistant…", "Send", and "Resize agent panel".
- 69f5ab0: Translate the four File-menu keys (`toolbar.open`, `toolbar.openShortcut`, `toolbar.save`, `toolbar.saveShortcut`) in `de.json`, `pl.json`, and `pt-BR.json` so German, Polish, and Brazilian-Portuguese users see localized labels instead of the English fallback. All three locales are now at 100% coverage.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6094eaf: Built-in agent panel + chat primitives + expanded toolkit so consumers can plug a streaming AI agent into the editor in ~50 lines. See [`docs/agents.md`](../docs/agents.md).

  ### Agent panel
  - `<DocxEditor agentPanel={{ render }}>` — controllable right-hand dock with toolbar toggle, drag-to-resize, persisted width, animated open/close. Render-prop receives `{ close }`; controlled mode (`open` + `onOpenChange`) lets a parent drive it.
  - New `agent-sparkle` icon and i18n keys across en / de / pl / pt-BR.

  ### Chat primitives (opinionated, optional)
  - `<AgentChatLog>`, `<AgentComposer>`, `<AgentSuggestionChip>`, `<AgentTimeline>` — Google-Docs-style UI for message list, composer, starter chips, and a collapsible tool-call timeline (per-row spinner while streaming, auto-collapses to "N steps" on done).
  - New types: `AgentMessage`, `AgentToolCall`.

  ### Toolkit (`@eigenpal/docx-editor-agents`)
  - Four new tools: `apply_formatting`, `set_paragraph_style`, `read_page`, `read_pages`.
  - `useDocxAgentTools` hook with `include` / `exclude` filters; `executeToolCall` enforces them.
  - `AgentToolDefinition.displayName` for friendly UI labels.
  - New subpath exports — package stays runtime-agnostic, AI SDK helpers are opt-in:
    - `/server` — `getToolSchemas`, `executeToolCall`, `getToolDisplayName` (OpenAI function-calling format)
    - `/react` — `useDocxAgentTools`
    - `/ai-sdk/server` — `getAiSdkTools()` returning `streamText({ tools })` shape
    - `/ai-sdk/react` — `toAgentMessages()` adapting `useChat`'s `UIMessage[]` to `AgentMessage[]`
  - `WordCompatBridge` parity contract — compile-time assertion that `EditorBridge` covers `Range.font.*` and `ParagraphFormat.style`.

  ### Bug fixes
  - **Rapid sequential `addComment` calls now all persist.** The unified `setComments` setter read a stale `commentsRef.current` for every call; a 30-comment burst kept only the last. Now assigns `commentsRef.current` synchronously in uncontrolled mode.

  ### Spec / Word-API hardening
  - **`paraId` allocator** — new `ParaIdAllocatorExtension` assigns fresh 8-char hex `w14:paraId`s on Enter / paste / split. Without this the agent's anchors silently drifted whenever the user typed Enter. Marked `addToHistory: false`.
  - **`apply_formatting`** validates `underline.style` against ECMA-376 §17.3.2.40 `ST_Underline` and `highlight` against §17.3.2.15 `ST_HighlightColor`. Out-of-spec values return a structured error instead of round-tripping invalid OOXML.
  - **`set_paragraph_style`** returns `false` for ids not in `styles.xml` — matches Word's `ItemNotFound` behavior.

  ### Public API additions

  `@eigenpal/docx-js-editor`: `<AgentPanel>`, `<AgentChatLog>`, `<AgentComposer>`, `<AgentSuggestionChip>`, `<AgentTimeline>`, matching prop types, `AgentMessage`, `AgentToolCall`. `DocxEditorRef` gains `applyFormatting`, `setParagraphStyle`, `getPageContent`.

  `@eigenpal/docx-editor-agents`: new `/ai-sdk/server` and `/ai-sdk/react` subpaths (peer dep `ai`, optional). `/server` and `/react` unchanged. `displayName` on `AgentToolDefinition`.

  ### Known limitations (v1.1)
  - Missing Word `Range.font.*` properties: `superscript`, `subscript`, `allCaps`, `smallCaps`, `doubleStrikeThrough`, `colorTheme` tint/shade.
  - No paragraph-level mutators (`alignment`, `lineSpacing`, `spaceBefore`, `spaceAfter`) wired through the toolkit yet.

- 9c0721b: Add `disableFindReplaceShortcuts` to `DocxEditor` so host apps can let the browser handle native Cmd/Ctrl+F and Cmd/Ctrl+H shortcuts.
- c81fdd3: # Live agent chat + server-side MCP support

  A Word-API-style bridge that lets an AI agent read a DOCX, comment on it, suggest tracked changes, and scroll the view — live in a running editor, or server-side against a parsed file. Same tool catalog, same shape, two transports.

  ## The pattern

  Locate, then mutate. The agent calls a locate tool (`read_document`, `read_selection`, `find_text`) which returns paragraphs tagged with their stable Word `w14:paraId`. It passes those paraIds to mutate tools. paraIds survive concurrent edits and tool-loop iterations; ordinal indices don't.

  ## Ten agent tools

  OpenAI function-calling format (also accepted by Anthropic / Vercel AI SDK):
  - **Locate** — `read_document`, `read_selection`, `find_text`, `read_comments`, `read_changes`
  - **Mutate** — `add_comment`, `suggest_change` (one tool, three modes via empty-string semantics: replacement / deletion / insertion at paragraph end), `reply_comment`, `resolve_comment`
  - **Navigate** — `scroll`

  Exported from `@eigenpal/docx-editor-agents` as `agentTools`, `getToolSchemas()`, `executeToolCall(name, args, bridge)`.

  ## Two bridges, same interface

  Everything wires into an `EditorBridge` interface. Two implementations ship:

  ```ts
  // Live editor in a browser
  import { useAgentChat } from '@eigenpal/docx-editor-agents/bridge';
  const { executeToolCall, toolSchemas } = useAgentChat({ editorRef, author: 'AI' });

  // Server-side, against a parsed DOCX
  import { DocxReviewer, createReviewerBridge } from '@eigenpal/docx-editor-agents';
  const reviewer = await DocxReviewer.fromBuffer(buffer, 'AI');
  const bridge = createReviewerBridge(reviewer);
  const result = executeToolCall('add_comment', { paraId, text }, bridge);
  ```

  Both expose the same 10 tools to the agent. The bridge layer abstracts the transport.

  ## MCP server (built-in, spec 2025-06-18)

  ```ts
  import { McpServer, createReviewerBridge, DocxReviewer } from '@eigenpal/docx-editor-agents';
  import { McpServer as _ } from '@eigenpal/docx-editor-agents/mcp';

  const server = new McpServer(bridge, { name: 'my-saas', version: '1.0.0' });
  const reply = server.handle(jsonRpcMessage); // sync, transport-free, never throws
  ```

  - **Transport-agnostic core**: wire `server.handle()` to HTTP-SSE, WebSocket, your queue worker, or a managed stdio process. The library does not pick a transport.
  - **stdio adapter** for customers who want to run the server inside a worker pool: `runStdioServer(bridge)` (Node-only).
  - **Spec compliance**: `initialize` / `tools/list` / `tools/call` / `ping`. Tool failures use the spec's `{isError: true, content: [...]}` envelope inside a successful JSON-RPC response; JSON-RPC errors are reserved for protocol-level problems. Includes UTF-8-safe chunk decoding (multi-byte codepoints don't break across stdio chunks) and a buffer cap to prevent memory DoS.

  A local-install stdio bin was prototyped and removed: one-document-per-config is the wrong shape for a contract-review product. The right deployment is a hosted MCP service the customer operates with their own auth + storage.

  ## Events

  `bridge.onContentChange(listener)` and `bridge.onSelectionChange(listener)` (both return unsubscribe functions) let host apps and MCP servers react to edits without owning the single React callback prop.
  - `ContentChangeEvent` ships `{ commentCount, changeCount, comments, changes }`.
  - `SelectionChangeEvent` ships the current `SelectionInfo` or `null`. (Reviewer bridge: never fires — no caret in headless mode.)

  ## New on `DocxEditorRef`

  ```ts
  addComment({ paraId, text, author, search? }) → number | null
  replyToComment(commentId, text, author)        → number | null
  resolveComment(commentId)                       → void
  proposeChange({ paraId, search, replaceWith, author }) → boolean
  findInDocument(query, { caseSensitive?, limit? }) → FoundMatch[]
  getSelectionInfo()                              → SelectionInfo | null
  getComments()                                   → Comment[]
  onContentChange(listener)                       → () => void
  onSelectionChange(listener)                     → () => void
  ```

  `scrollToParaId` was already public.

  ## New on `@eigenpal/docx-core`

  `findParagraphByParaId(doc, paraId)` returns the PM range for a paragraph by paraId.

  ## Word JS API parity contract

  `WordCompatBridge` (exported type from the package root) formally documents every Office.js Word API method we mirror. A compile-time static assertion enforces that `EditorBridge` satisfies it. If we drop or change a method that's part of the public Word-API mirror, typecheck breaks.

  ## Demos
  - **`examples/agent-use-demo` (roast-my-doc)** — server-side demo of the canonical "build your own MCP-shaped agent server" pattern: parse → `createReviewerBridge` → `agentTools` → tool-call loop with `executeToolCall` → `toBuffer()`. The route's preamble shows the one-line diff to convert it to a real MCP server.
  - **`examples/agent-chat-demo` (chat with your doc)** — live editor + chat panel. Demonstrates `useAgentChat` against a running `<DocxEditor>`.

  Both demos support `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` env var for production deployments (open by default for local dev), forward client `AbortSignal` to OpenAI calls, and cap upload size.

  ## Hardening
  - `proposeChange` refuses to layer onto an existing tracked-change run (would produce invalid OOXML).
  - Ambiguous `search` arguments return an error instead of silently mistargeting.
  - `scroll` does not steal the user's caret.
  - Comment IDs and tracked-change revisionIds use the shared monotonic counter to avoid collisions in OOXML.
  - Mark guards if a host StarterKit omits `comment` / `insertion` / `deletion` extensions.

  ## Spec

  `specs/live-agent-chat.md`.

- 8dba7e8: # Word-style split button for text + highlight color (issue #130)

  Closes [#130](https://github.com/eigenpal/docx-editor/issues/130).

  The font-color and highlight-color toolbar buttons are now Word-style split buttons. Two halves:
  - **Apply half (icon + swatch):** click to re-apply the last color you picked. No dropdown.
  - **Arrow half (▾):** click to open the full color picker (theme grid, standard colors, custom hex, "no color").

  Pick a color once, then for every subsequent occurrence just click the swatch — one click instead of three.

  ## API surface (consolidated)

  The package previously shipped two color pickers — a simple `ColorPicker` and a fuller `AdvancedColorPicker`. The two have been merged into a single `ColorPicker` with two new props:
  - `splitButton?: boolean` — default `true`. Set `false` to render a legacy single-button shape.
  - `defaultColor?: ColorValue | string` — initial "last picked" color used by the apply half before the user picks anything. Defaults: text → red, highlight → yellow, border → black.

  The "last picked" memory is independent of the current selection's color (matches Word). Picking "Automatic" / "No color" does NOT update it.

  ## Breaking changes
  - The legacy `ColorPicker` (the simpler grid picker that ran inline, not via dropdown) has been **removed**. Its types `ColorOption` and the old `ColorPickerProps` shape are no longer exported.
  - `AdvancedColorPicker` has been **renamed to `ColorPicker`**. Update imports:

    ```diff
    - import { AdvancedColorPicker } from '@eigenpal/docx-js-editor';
    + import { ColorPicker } from '@eigenpal/docx-js-editor';
    ```

    The exported `ColorPickerProps` and `ColorPickerMode` types now correspond to the renamed component (formerly `AdvancedColorPickerProps` / `AdvancedColorPickerMode`).

  - CSS class names changed from `docx-advanced-color-picker-*` → `docx-color-picker-*`. If you targeted these in user CSS overrides, update the selectors.

  ## Migration

  No changes needed inside the library — text-color, highlight-color, table-cell-fill, and table-border-color buttons all use the new `ColorPicker` automatically. If you import `AdvancedColorPicker` directly, switch to `ColorPicker`. If you used the legacy simpler `ColorPicker`, the new `ColorPicker` is a drop-in for any case that benefits from the fuller picker; otherwise build a small custom picker — the legacy one was thin enough to inline.

### Patch Changes

- 71a1836: Replace hardcoded `816` page-width literals in `DocxEditor` with the existing
  `DEFAULT_PAGE_WIDTH` constant exported from `PagedEditor`, and fold the two
  duplicated `pageWidth` fallback expressions into a single `pageWidthPx` value
  shared by `UnifiedSidebar` and `CommentMarginMarkers`.
- f31fd5a: Fix document outline overlap and ruler behavior
  - Outline panel no longer sits on top of the page. On wide viewports the
    page stays where it was (centered, or translated left by the comments
    sidebar) — only the layout's min-width grows so the centered page never
    overlaps the panel. On narrow viewports the page + outline scroll
    horizontally as a unit instead.
  - Outline panel header lines up with the doc's top margin and uses a
    transparent background so the page's left-side shadow stays visible when
    the viewport is squeezed.
  - Vertical ruler stays pinned to the viewport's left edge during horizontal
    scroll instead of scrolling out of view.
  - Horizontal ruler is now sticky inside the scroll container, so it scrolls
    horizontally with the doc and stays put on vertical scroll. Padding tracks
    the outline (right shift) and comments sidebar (left shift) so the ruler
    centers against the same axis as the page.
  - Editor surround uses `--doc-bg` uniformly so the over-scroll/rubber-band
    area matches the gutter.

- 6a0b9a9: Fix crash when accepting a tracked replacement.

  The `paragraphChangeTracker` plugin walked `tr.steps` using each step's raw
  `from`/`to`/`pos` against `tr.doc` (the final doc after every step has been
  applied). Those coords are valid only in the doc as it was _when that step
  ran_, so a later doc-shrinking step could leave the earlier step's coords
  past the final doc end and crash `Fragment.nodesBetween` on
  `undefined.nodeSize`.

  Concretely: `acceptChange` emits `[RemoveMarkStep, ReplaceStep]` when the
  range contains both an `insertion` mark and a `deletion` (a tracked
  replace). The replace shrinks the doc, the mark step's `to` becomes
  invalid in `tr.doc`, and the editor crashes.

  Remap each step's coords through `tr.mapping.slice(stepIndex + 1)` before
  using them with `tr.doc`, and skip steps whose range was fully consumed by
  a later deletion. Adds a regression test reproducing the
  accept-tracked-replacement crash shape.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- 1a9d8eb: Fix caret rendering at the wrong height after changing font size/family in an empty paragraph. The paragraph measurement cache key didn't include `defaultFontSize`/`defaultFontFamily`, so empty paragraphs with different default fonts collided on the same key and the cache returned a stale measurement until the user typed a character.
- 1a9d8eb: Fix font/size/color/highlight changes silently dropping when applied in an empty paragraph (e.g. right after pressing Enter). The mark commands set stored marks before updating the paragraph node, but every transform step clears stored marks — so the chosen value was wiped before dispatch and typed text fell back to the editor default. Reordered so node updates run first.
- 14d7623: ci(release): fix Slack notification release link to use per-package tag (changesets fixed-group ships @eigenpal/docx-js-editor@X.Y.Z, not vX.Y.Z)

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 91a6f97: Add `fontFamilies` prop to `DocxEditor` to customize the toolbar's font dropdown.

  Pass either bare strings or full `FontOption` objects (or a mix). Strings render in the "Other" group; `FontOption[]` enables CSS fallback chains and category grouping. Omitting the prop preserves the existing 12-font default. Closes #278.

  ```tsx
  <DocxEditor
    fontFamilies={[
      'Arial',
      { name: 'Roboto', fontFamily: 'Roboto, sans-serif', category: 'sans-serif' },
    ]}
  />
  ```

### Patch Changes

- b10a517: Fix three toolbar tooltips/labels that ignored the `i18n` prop and rendered as English regardless of locale: the comments-sidebar toggle, the outline-toggle button, and the Editing / Suggesting / Viewing mode dropdown (including its descriptions). The translation keys already existed in `de.json` and `pl.json`; the components were just bypassing `useTranslation()`. Now wired through correctly.

## 0.0.35

### Patch Changes

- bcc9c6d: Fix a regression where clicking the checkmark of a resolved comment did not re-open the comment card (issue #268). `PagedEditor.updateSelectionOverlay` fired `onSelectionChange` from every overlay redraw — including ResizeObserver and layout/font callbacks — not only on actual selection changes. When the sidebar card resize (or any window resize) triggered a redraw, the parent received a spurious callback with the unchanged cursor and cleared the just-set expansion. Dedup by PM state identity (immutable references) so consumers are only notified for real selection / doc / stored-marks changes.

  Also: cursor-based sidebar expansion now skips resolved comments. Moving the cursor through previously-commented text no longer re-opens old resolved threads — they stay collapsed to the checkmark marker until the user explicitly clicks it.
