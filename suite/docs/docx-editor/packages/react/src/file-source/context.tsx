/**
 * React provider + hook for the chosen FileSource.
 *
 * The host app calls `chooseFileSource()` once at boot, awaits it,
 * then wraps the editor tree in `<FileSourceProvider source={…}>`.
 * Everything inside reads it via `useFileSource()`; nothing branches
 * on `kind` unless it absolutely must.
 *
 * Why the provider is sync (takes a resolved FileSource) rather than
 * doing the probe itself: keeping the React tree free of async-init
 * dances means the editor never has to render a "loading source"
 * fallback. The app is responsible for awaiting the probe and showing
 * its own splash / auth gate.
