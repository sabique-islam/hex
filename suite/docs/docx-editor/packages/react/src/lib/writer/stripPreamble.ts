/**
 * Strip Llama-1B "preamble pollution" — sentences the model
 * compulsively prepends to its answers despite system prompts telling
 * it not to.
 *
 * JSON-mode + `response_format` keeps the OUTER shape valid, but the
 * model still writes `{"rewrite": "Here is the rewritten passage: …"}`
 * because the schema only constrains the JSON tree, not the natural
 * language inside a string value.
 *
 * Strategy: a leading-line regex that matches the common preamble
 * shapes — "Here is …", "Sure, here's …", "I'd be happy to …",
 * "Below is …", "Here are …". Removes ONLY when the preamble appears
 * at the very start, and the cleaned remainder is non-empty. Never
 * touches the middle of the text.
 *
 * Also drops a trailing "Let me know if …" tail, which is the other
 * polite-assistant flourish the model can't resist.
