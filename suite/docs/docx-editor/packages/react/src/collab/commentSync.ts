 * Collab transport for comment threads. Comment highlight marks ride

 * replies, resolved state — lives in React state and would NOT reach peers.
 * This bridges DocxEditor's controlled `comments` + `onCommentsChange` API to a
 * shared `comments` Y.Map keyed by comment id.
 *
 * Model: one Y.Map entry per Comment (replies are separate Comments with
 * `parentId`). Concurrency:
 *   - two peers adding different comments → different keys → merge cleanly.
 *   - two peers editing the SAME comment → last-write-wins on that key.
 * That's the right granularity for v1 (each thread/reply is independent).
