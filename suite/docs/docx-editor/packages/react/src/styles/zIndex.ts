/**
 * Z-index stacking order for editor chrome.
 *
 * Single source of truth so layered UI doesn't drift into ad-hoc numbers.
 *
 * Order, low to high:
 *   page content (default 0)
 *   HF inline editor      — sits above page content, below chrome
 *   ruler                 — must stay readable when HF editor is active
 *   dropdown / popover    — opens from toolbar buttons or HF options
 *   menubar trio          — File / Edit / View dropdown stack:
 *                            backdrop catches outside clicks,
 *                            panel renders above it,
 *                            trigger sits a notch above the panel so
 *                            an adjacent menu's trigger click reaches
 *                            it in a single pointer-down (the open
 *                            menu's backdrop would otherwise eat it).
 *   context menu / modal  — top-most, transient surfaces
