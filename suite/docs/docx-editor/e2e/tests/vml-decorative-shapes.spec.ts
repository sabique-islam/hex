/**
 * Decorative VML shapes — openspec `drawing-shapes-render` foundation.
 *
 * Pre-fix, a `<w:pict>` containing a `<v:rect>` (no inner text) was
 * silently dropped: the parser's textbox path required a `<v:textbox>`
 * child, and there was no other route for decorative shapes. Common in
 * SDS-style docs that use thin filled rectangles as page dividers.
 *
 * The fix parses `<v:rect>` / `<v:oval>` / `<v:line>` as `TextBox`-
 * shaped records with a single empty paragraph as content (PM textBox
 * schema requires `(paragraph | table)+`) and the rect's fill +
 * outline + position. The existing `renderTextBoxFragment` paints the
 * box from those fields regardless of inner text.
 *
 * Fixture has one 200pt × 4pt red rectangle between two text
 * paragraphs. Assertions:
 *   1. The painted DOM contains exactly one extra `.layout-textbox`
 *      element with a red background.
 *   2. Both surrounding text paragraphs paint normally.
 *
 * Coverage gain on the SDS reference doc: initial-viewport textbox
 * count went 1 → 7 after this change.
