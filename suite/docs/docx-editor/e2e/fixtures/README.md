### wrap-none-positioned-image-demo.docx

Used to reproduce anchored images that should paint independently without adding
paragraph flow height or text-wrap margins.

### wrap-none-two-seals-title-box-demo.docx

A synthetic title-page document containing two `behindDoc` `wp:wrapNone` images
aligned to the left and right margins around a centered title box. Used to
reproduce multiple non-wrapping anchored images on the same page.

### image-layout-modes-demo.docx

layout modes — `wp:inline` (in-line), `wp:wrapSquare` (wrap-around float), and
`wp:wrapTopAndBottom` (full-width block) — in a single document. Used by
`e2e/tests/image-layout-modes.spec.ts` to lock in correct rendering of all
three paths side by side.
