/**
 * M1b editing-experience contract — COLLAB CONVERGENCE (2-client Yjs smoke).
 *
 * SKIPPED BY DEFAULT. The default Playwright `webServer` boots the
 * single-document demo (examples/vite, `bun run dev` → :5173), which does
 * NOT mount the Yjs/y-prosemirror collaboration plugins. The collaborative
 * surface lives in a SEPARATE example (examples/collaboration) that:
 *   - is served by its own Vite config (examples/collaboration/vite.config.ts)
 *   - syncs over y-webrtc against PUBLIC signaling servers
 *     (wss://signaling.yjs.dev …) — non-deterministic and frequently
 *     unreachable from CI, so a convergence assertion would be flaky.
 *
 * To exercise convergence locally, run the collaboration example and set
 * the two env vars below, then run this single spec:
 *
 *   # terminal 1 — serve the collaborative editor
 *   bun run --cwd examples/collaboration dev   # serves on :5174
 *
 *   # terminal 2 — point the spec at it and run just this file
 *   COLLAB_E2E=1 COLLAB_URL=http://localhost:5174 \
 *     npx playwright test e2e/editing-experience/collab-convergence.spec.ts
 *
 * When COLLAB_E2E is unset the suite records a skipped test so the gap is
 * visible in the report rather than silently absent.
 *
 * CI-FEASIBLE PATH FORWARD (planned — 2026-07-19 audit, tracker 27):
 * Replace the flaky public y-webrtc signaling with a deterministic in-process
 * server: add `@hocuspocus/server` as a devDep and, in a dedicated CI job,
 * spawn it on an ephemeral port, then drive two `HocuspocusProvider` clients
 * (the SAME provider production uses) against it and assert Y.Doc convergence.
 * This exercises the real wire protocol without the collab server repo (which
 * is a separate, currently-unvendored submodule) and without public signaling.
