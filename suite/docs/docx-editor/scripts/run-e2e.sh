# `docker compose up editor` container already runs it) and just run
# playwright. Use playwright.docker.config.ts which drops the webServer block
# so playwright doesn't try to start a second vite.
#
# Bun is the only runtime in the bun image — no curl/wget. We probe with
# `bun -e fetch(...)` and start our own vite only if nothing's listening.
